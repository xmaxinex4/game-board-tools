      description: "Brass: Birmingham is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace' 2007 masterpiece, Brass. Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&#10;&#10;It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor. As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands. The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&#10;&#10;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&#10;&#10;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&#10;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&#10;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&#10;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&#10;5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&#10;&#10;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&#10;&#10;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&#10;&#10;",

      description: "Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.&#10;&#10;After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.&#10;&#10;Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.&#10;&#10;During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.&#10;&#10;Part of the Pandemic series&#10;&#10;",

Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.&#10;&#10;This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a &ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure&rdquo; book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player&rsquo;s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat.&#10;&#10;",

      description: "Twilight Imperium (Fourth Edition) is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political maneuvering, and economic bargaining. Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;No two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.&#10;&#10;A round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these roles are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empire, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways.&#10;&#10;After every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them with every round. Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game. Play continues until a player reaches ten victory points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

      description: "Dune: Imperium is a game that uses deck-building to add a hidden-information angle to traditional worker placement. It finds inspiration in elements and characters from the Dune legacy, both the new film from Legendary Pictures and the seminal literary series from Frank Herbert, Brian Herbert, and Kevin J. Anderson.&#10;&#10;As a leader of one of the Great Houses of the Landsraad, raise your banner and marshal your forces and spies. War is coming, and at the center of the conflict is Arrakis &ndash; Dune, the desert planet.&#10;&#10;You start with a unique leader card, as well as a deck identical to those of your opponents.  As you acquire cards and build your deck, your choices will define your strengths and weaknesses. Cards allow you to send your Agents to certain spaces on the game board, so how your deck evolves affects your strategy. You might become more powerful militarily, able to deploy more troops than your opponents. Or you might acquire cards that give you an edge with the four political factions represented in the game: the Emperor, the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit, and the Fremen.&#10;&#10;Unlike many deck-building games, you don&rsquo;t play your entire hand in one turn. Instead, you draw a hand of cards at the start of every round and alternate with other players, taking one Agent turn at a time (playing one card to send one of your Agents to the game board). When it&rsquo;s your turn and you have no more Agents to place, you&rsquo;ll take a Reveal turn, revealing the rest of your cards, which will provide Persuasion and Swords. Persuasion is used to acquire more cards, and Swords help your troops fight for the current round&rsquo;s rewards as shown on the revealed Conflict card.&#10;&#10;Defeat your rivals in combat, shrewdly navigate the political factions, and acquire precious cards. The Spice must flow to lead your House to victory!&#10;&#10;Some important links: The Official FAQ, the Unofficial FAQ, and an Automa (solo and 2p) Overview&#10;&#10;",

Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.&#10;&#10;The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards and actually playing them. Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards. Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.&#10;&#10;Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation and consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;1) Player order shifts clockwise.&#10;2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.&#10;3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.&#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&#10;&#10;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!&#10;&#10;",

Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.&#10;&#10;The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle-earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle-earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle-earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.&#10;&#10;Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).&#10;&#10;Action Dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal game-play. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.&#10;&#10;",

The game includes four new characters &mdash; Valrath Red Guard (tank, crowd control), Inox Hatchet (ranged damage), Human Voidwarden (support, mind-control), and Quatryl Demolitionist (melee damage, obstacle manipulation) &mdash; that can also be used in the original Gloomhaven game.&#10;&#10;The game also includes 16 monster types (including seven new standard monsters and three new bosses) and a new campaign with 25 scenarios that invites the heroes to investigate a case of mysterious disappearances within the city. Is it the work of Vermlings, or is something far more sinister going on?&#10;&#10;Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is aimed at a more casual audience to get people into the gameplay more quickly. All of the hard-to-organize cardboard map tiles have been removed, and instead players will play on the scenario book itself, which features new artwork unique to each scenario. The last barrier to entry &mdash; i.e., learning the game &mdash; has also been lowered through a simplified rule set and a five-scenario tutorial that will ease new players into the experience.&#10;&#10;",

      description: "Star Wars: Rebellion is a board game of epic conflict between the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance for two to four players.&#10;&#10;Experience the Galactic Civil War like never before. In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:&#10;&#10;     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.&#10;     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.&#10;&#10;&#10;Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.&#10;&#10;Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!&#10;&#10;",

      description: "In the most distant reaches of the world, magic still exists, embodied by spirits of the land, of the sky, and of every natural thing. As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.&#10;&#10;Spirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.&#10;&#10;The Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present. The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.&#10;&#10;The game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history. At game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.&#10;&#10;The game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.&#10;&#10;",

Kennedy&#10;&#10;In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year  dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new &quot;superpowers&quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.&#10;&#10;Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?&#10;&#10;Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.&#10;&#10;Components (original edition):&#10;&#10;&#10;     228 full colour counters &#10;     22&quot;x34&quot; full colour map &#10;     103 event cards &#10;     2 six-sided dice&#10;     1 24-page rulebook&#10;     2 full colour player aid cards&#10;&#10;&#10;Components (2009 Deluxe edition and after)&#10;&#10;     260 full colour counters &#10;     22&quot;x34&quot; mounted map with revised graphics&#10;     110 event cards&#10;     2 six-sided dice&#10;     1 24-page rulebook&#10;     2 full colour player aid cards&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:     approx. 3-5 years per turn&#10;MAP SCALE:     Point-to-point system&#10;UNIT SCALE:     Influence markers&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     2&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Ananda Gupta &amp; Jason Matthews&#10;MAP, CARD, &amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch&#10;&#10;&#10;A deluxe edition, published in 2009 includes the following changes from the basic game:&#10;&#10;     Mounted map with revised graphics&#10;     Two double-thick counter sheets with 260 counters&#10;     Deck of 110 event cards (increased from 103)&#10;     Revised rules and player aid cards&#10;     Revised at start setup and text change for card #98 Aldrich Ames&#10;&#10;&#10;Upgrade kit for the owners of the previous version includes the following:&#10;&#10;     Mounted Map with revised graphics&#10;     New card decks&#10;     Updated Rules &amp; Charts&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.&#10;&#10;One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.&#10;&#10;",

While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.&#10;&#10;The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.&#10;&#10;The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points.  Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the fifth phase is played to completion.  Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods.  Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;The rules include basic and advanced versions.&#10;&#10;This game is #14 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;There is a separate BGG entry for the 2019 edition: The Castles of Burgundy.  The 2019 edition includes, alongside the base game, eight expansions, seven of which had already been released separately as promotional items and one new to the 2019 release.&#10;&#10;UPC 4005556812431&#10;&#10;",

      description: "It is a time of unrest in 1920s Europa. The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&#10;&#10;Scythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place). Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness. Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;",

      description: "In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders. Over three ages, players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders. What's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players.&#10;&#10;Players do not draft cards simultaneously from decks of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play, as it can with bonus moves that allow the player to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each acquired card can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder. Each player also starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.&#10;&#10;Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as they are acquired, the cost for those resources increases for the opponent, representing the owner's dominance in this area.&#10;&#10;You can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital (also giving you a bonus at certain positions). If you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately. Or if you acquire six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately. If none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

      description: "Brass: Lancashire &mdash; first published as Brass &mdash; is an economic strategy game that tells the story of competing cotton entrepreneurs in Lancashire during the industrial revolution. You must develop, build, and establish your industries and network so that you can capitalize demand for iron, coal and cotton. The game is played over two halves: the canal phase and the rail phase. To win the game, score the most victory points (VPs), which are counted at the end of each half. VPs are gained from your canals, rails, and established (flipped) industry tiles. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Build an industry tile&#10;    Build a rail or canal&#10;    Develop an industry&#10;    Sell cotton&#10;    Take a loan&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of a player's turn, they replace the two cards they played with two more from the deck. Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn, from lowest spent first to highest spent. This turn order mechanism opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order, allowing for the possibility of back-to-back turns.&#10;&#10;After all the cards have been played the first time (with the deck size being adjusted for the number of players), the canal phase ends and a scoring round commences. After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed for the game, after which new cards are dealt and the rail phase begins. During this phase, players may now occupy more than one location in a city and a double-connection build (though expensive) is possible. At the end of the rail phase, another scoring round takes place, then a winner is crowned.&#10;&#10;The cards limit where you can build your industries, but any card can be used for the develop, sell cotton or build connections actions. This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards. Resources are common so that if one player builds a rail line (which requires coal) they have to use the coal from the nearest source, which may be an opponent's coal mine, which in turn gets that coal mine closer to scoring (i.e., being utilized).&#10;&#10;Brass: Lancashire, the 2018 edition from Roxley Games, reboots the original Warfrog Games edition of Brass with new artwork and components, as well as a few rules changes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The virtual link rules between Birkenhead have been made optional.&#10;     The three-player experience has been brought closer to the ideal experience of four players by shortening each half of the game by one round and tuning the deck and distant market tiles slightly to ensure a consistent experience.&#10;     Two-player rules have been created and are playable without the need for an alternate board.&#10;     The level 1 cotton mill is now worth 5 VP to make it slightly less terrible.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

You are reliving the cultural achievements, mercantile expeditions, and pillages of those tribes we know as Viking today &mdash; a term that was used quite differently towards the end of the first millennium.&#10;&#10;When the northerners went out for a raid, they used to say they headed out for a viking. Their Scandinavian ancestors, however, were much more than just pirates. They were explorers and founders of states. Leif Eriksson is said to be the first European in America, long before Columbus.&#10;In what is known today as Normandy, the intruders were not called Vikings but Normans. One of them is the famous William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066. He managed to do what the king of Norway failed to do only a few years prior: conquer the Throne of England. The reason why the people of these times became such strong seafarers is due to their unfortunate agricultural situation. Crop shortfalls caused great distress.&#10;&#10;In this game, you will raid and explore new territories. You will also experience their day-to-day activities: collecting goods to achieve a financially secure position in society. In the end, the player whose possessions bear the greatest value will be declared the winner.&#10;&#10;--gameplay description from @StoryBoardGamer's review:&#10;A Feast for Odin is a points-driven game, with plethora of pathways to victory, with a range of risk balanced against reward. A significant portion of this is your central hall, which has a whopping -86 points of squares and a major part of your game is attempting to cover these up with various tiles. Likewise, long halls and island colonies can also offer large rewards, but they will have penalties of their own.&#10;&#10;Each year follows a familiar pattern of preparation, worker placement, and then meeting the requirements of your feast. The main phase of each year is a worker placement affair. You start with a selection of Vikings, and a large action board with a whopping 61 different options to choose from. Each of these will be arranged from left to right in one of four columns. Each column requires an additional Viking to activate, but they are proportionally more powerful.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, you will need to fill a feast table with food, alternating between plants and vegetable matter. You will also have a chance to lay the valuable green and blue tiles into your main hall. The configuration of these tiles must follow certain requirements, but your main goal is to both cover up a line of coin icons to increase your income, while otherwise encircling certain printed icons to generate those.&#10;&#10;You will build your engine over time, following an alternating pattern of outward expansion and hunting against development and cultivation. It all comes down to how much you&rsquo;re willing to take on at any one time, and what risks you&rsquo;re willing to set yourself up with for their rewards.&#10;&#10;UPC 681706716909&#10;&#10;",

Each player governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft, the player must attempt to rule as great an area as possible and to develop that group's skills. There are also four religious cults in which you can progress. To do all that, each group has special skills and abilities.&#10;&#10;Taking turns, the players execute their actions on the resources they have at their disposal. Different buildings allow players to develop different resources. Dwellings allow for more workers. Trading houses allow players to make money. Strongholds unlock a group's special ability, and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary. Each group must also develop its terraforming skill and its skill with boats to use the rivers. The groups in question, along with their home landscape, are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Desert (Fakirs, Nomads)&#10;    Plains (Halflings, Cultists)&#10;    Swamp (Alchemists, Darklings)&#10;    Lake (Mermaids, Swarmlings)&#10;    Forest (Witches, Auren)&#10;    Mountain (Dwarves, Engineers)&#10;    Wasteland (Giants, Chaos Magicians)&#10;&#10;&#10;Proximity to other groups is a double-edged sword in Terra Mystica.

Blurring the traditional lines between role-playing and card game experiences, Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a Living Card Game of Lovecraftian mystery, monsters, and madness!&#10;&#10;In the game, you and your friend (or up to three friends with two Core Sets) become characters within the quiet New England town of Arkham. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.&#10;&#10;No matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries.&#10;&#10;Each of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the Ancient Ones straining against the barriers to our world...&#10;&#10;The basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground. All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand&mdash;and your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better prepare yourself for the adventures that still lie before you.&#10;&#10;",

There, a group of mercenaries at the end of their rope will help bring back this settlement from the edge of destruction. Not only will they have to deal with the harsh elements, but there are other, far more dangerous threats out in the unforgiving cold as well. There are Algox, the bigger, more yeti-like cousins of the Inox, attacking from the mountains; Lurkers flooding in from the northern sea; and rumors of machines that wander the frozen wastes of their own free will. The party of mercenaries must face all of these perils, and perhaps in doing so, make peace with these new races so they can work together against even more sinister forces.&#10;&#10;Frosthaven is a standalone adventure from the designer and publisher of Gloomhaven that features sixteen new characters, three new races, more than twenty new enemies, more than one hundred new items, and a new, 100-scenario campaign.  Characters and items from Gloomhaven will be usable in Frosthaven, and vice versa.&#10;&#10;In addition to having the well-known combat mechanisms of Gloomhaven, Frosthaven will feature much more to do outside of combat, such as numerous mysteries to solve, a seasonal event system to live through, and player control over how this ramshackle village expands, with each new building offering new ways to progress.&#10;&#10;Frosthaven has a whole new set of items but there is a mechanic for bringing items over from 'Gloomhaven'. However, as it is a remote location, these products get imported and are not there as standard. Resources are much more valuable and you have to build items through a crafting system rather than just buy them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Dripping with strategy, this fantasy-based RPG puts you in the skin of a new race and takes you on an adventure to the northern territories to root out and defeat growing enemy forces and of course the infamous &quot;baddie&quot; responsible.&#10;&#10;Team up or go it alone in a 1-4 player Coop or Solo play campaign. With over 100+ unique skill dice and 4-7 classes to choose from, every battle is its own mini challenge to figure out. Your adventure will consist of 8-12 battles before you reach your final destination and face off against one of a number of possible kingpins in order to win. Along the way, you will be faced with storyline decisions that will quickly have you weighing risk/reward, odds, and logic - with dice woven into every aspect! Your party will also be faced with other decisions: when to rest, when to explore, or even which fights to pursue! The Encounter cards offer fun plot twists and some comic relief, all while setting the stage for your next battle.&#10;&#10;",

First, the players must carefully plan their actions and handle their machinery, since both their action tokens and resources are stored on a Construction Wheel and will only be available after a full turn of the wheel. The better you manage your wheel, the earlier your resources and actions come back to you.&#10;&#10;Second, the water flow on the rivers depicted on the board is a shared and contested resource. Players have to intercept and store as much of the water as they can, build dams (upstream dams are expensive but can block part of the water before it reaches the downstream dams), raise the dams to increase their capacity, and build long tunnels to channel the water to their powerhouses. Water is never consumed &mdash; its flow is just used to produce energy &mdash;, it is instead released back to the rivers, so you have to strategically place your dams to recover the water diverted by you and the other players.&#10;&#10;Over five rounds, the players must fulfill power requirements represented by a common competitive power track and meet specific requests of personal contracts. At the same time, by placing a limited number of engineers, they attempt to enhance their machinery to acquire new and more efficient construction actions and to build and activate special unique-effect buildings to forward their own developing strategy.&#10;&#10;",

They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.&#10;&#10;The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.&#10;&#10;Fortunately for the vineyard owners, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful. Using those workers and visitors, the vineyard owners can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines, and filling wine orders, working towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany.&#10;&#10;Viticulture Essential Edition includes the base game of Viticulture and a few of the most popular modules from the original Tuscany expansion, including Mamas &amp; Papas, Fields (previously known as Properties), expanded and revised Visitors, and Automa cards for a solo variant, along with a few minor rule changes.&#10;&#10;",

      description: "In Pax Pamir, players assume the role of nineteenth century Afghan leaders attempting to forge a new state after the collapse of the Durrani Empire. Western histories often call this period &quot;The Great Game&quot; because of the role played by the Europeans who attempted to use central Asia as a theater for their own rivalries. In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.&#10;&#10;In terms of game play, Pax Pamir is a pretty straightforward tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game's map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game. That last point is worth emphasizing. Though everyone is building their own row of cards, the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly.&#10;&#10;To survive, players will organize into coalitions. Throughout the game, the dominance of the different coalitions will be evaluated by the players when a special card, called a &quot;Dominance Check&quot;, is resolved. If a single coalition has a commanding lead during one of these checks, those players loyal to that coalition will receive victory points based on their influence in their coalition. However, if Afghanistan remains fragmented during one of these checks, players instead will receive victory points based on their personal power base.&#10;&#10;After each Dominance Check, victory is checked and the game will be partially reset, offering players a fresh attempt to realize their ambitions. The game ends when a single player is able to achieve a lead of four or more victory points  or after the fourth and final Dominance Check is resolved.&#10;&#10;",

Three colored cards are placed along the edge of the main board  into 3 x 5 slots, which are also colored. Ideally players can place cards into slots of the same color. Then they can take both actions and advantages: the action depicted in the slot on the main board and also the advantage of the card. Actions and advantages can allow players to intake raw materials; to build and upgrade city domes, tunnels and production buildings such as farms, desalination devices and laboratories in their personal underwater area; to move their marker on the initiative track (which is important for player order in the next turn); to activate the player's &quot;A-cards&quot;; and to collect cards, both special ones and basic ones that allow for better decision possibilities during gameplay.&#10;&#10;All of the nearly 220 cards &mdash; whether special or basic &mdash; are divided into five types according to the way and time of use. Underwater areas are planned to be double-sided, giving players many opportunities to achieve VPs and finally win.&#10;&#10;",

      description: "In Puerto Rico, players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.&#10;&#10;Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.&#10;&#10;The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.&#10;&#10;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.&#10;&#10;Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.&#10;&#10;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.&#10;&#10;In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I &ndash; New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II &ndash; The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico, not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico. Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5, and they include variant rules for games with only two players.&#10;&#10;",

At the same time, you want to place wildlife tokens so that you can maximize the number of points scored by them, with the wildlife goals being determined at random by one of the four scoring cards for each type of wildlife.

In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.&#10;&#10;It's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.&#10;&#10;You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.&#10;&#10;Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies. The game also includes two new animals: dogs and donkeys.&#10;&#10;",

For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnar&ouml;k, the ultimate inescapable doom.&#10;&#10;Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These &ldquo;Gods&rsquo; Gifts&rdquo; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.&#10;&#10;Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents&rsquo; strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent&rsquo;s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!&#10;&#10;",

The surviving humans organized along four radically different ideologies, called Paths, to rebuild the world as they see fit: Harmony, Dominance, Progress, and Salvation. Followers of the four Paths live in a fragile peace, but in almost complete isolation next to each other. Their only meeting point is the last major city on Earth, now just known as the Capital.&#10;&#10;By powering up the mysterious Time Rifts that opened in the wake of the cataclysm, each Path is able to reach back to specific moments in their past. Doing so can greatly speed up their progress, but too much meddling may endanger the time-space continuum. But progress is more important than ever before: if the mysterious message arriving through the Time Rift is to be believed, an even more terrible cataclysm is looming on the horizon: an asteroid bearing the mysterious substance called Neutronium is heading towards Earth. Even stranger, the scientists show that the energy signature of the asteroid matches the explosion centuries ago...&#10;&#10;Anachrony features a unique two-tiered worker placement system. To travel to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources, players need not only various specialists (Engineers, Scientists, Administrators, and Geniuses) but also Exosuits to protect and enhance them &mdash; and both are in short supply.&#10;&#10;The game is played in 4-7 turns, depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs &mdash; unless, of course, it is averted! The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic timeline. By powering up the Time Rifts, players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past &quot;self&quot; with resources. Each Path has a vastly different objective that rewards it with a massive amount of victory points when achieved. The Paths' settlements will survive the impact, but the Capital will not. Whichever Path manages to collect most points will be the new seat for the Capital, thus the most important force left on the planet...&#10;&#10;",

Building shelters for Colonists to live in requires oxygen; generating oxygen requires plants; growing plants requires water; extracting water from ice requires power; generating power requires mining minerals; and mining minerals requires Colonists. Upgrading the colony&rsquo;s ability to provide each of these resources is vital. As the colony grows, more shelters are needed so that the Colonists can survive the inhospitable conditions on Mars.&#10;&#10;During the game, players are also trying to complete missions. Once a total of three missions have been completed, the game ends. To win the game, players must contribute to the development of the first colony on Mars. This is represented during the game by players gaining Opportunity Points (OP). The player with the most OP at the end of the game is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?&#10;&#10;The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.&#10;&#10;Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).&#10;Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.&#10;Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.&#10;Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions...&#10;&#10;",

Players representing different Mayan tribes place their workers on giant connected gears, and as the gears rotate they take the workers to different action spots.&#10;&#10;During a turn, players can either (a) place one or more workers on the lowest visible spot of the gears or (b) pick up one or more workers. When placing workers, they must pay corn, which is used as a currency in the game. When they pick up a worker, they perform certain actions depending on the position of the worker. Actions located &quot;later&quot; on the gears are more valuable, so it's wise to let the time work for you &ndash; but players cannot skip their turn; if they have all their workers on the gears, they have to pick some up.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;The game ends after one full revolution of the central Tzolkin gear. There are many paths to victory. Pleasing the gods by placing crystal skulls in deep caves or building many temples are just two of those many paths...&#10;&#10;",

      description: "Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition, while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.&#10;&#10;The objective of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.&#10;&#10;However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.&#10;&#10;Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.&#10;&#10;Power Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!

Players must carefully plan, however, to have the proper staff available to service the event and support guests as needed. The reward for success is new investment opportunities, permitting further renovation of the estate (acquisition of more valuable/powerful building tiles), an increase in reputation in the county, an expanding circle of influential acquaintances, and a larger and highly-trained domestic staff.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, a competitive courtship for the hand of the most eligible young gentleman and lady in the county presents specific renovation and reputation objectives.

In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire&rsquo;s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.&#10;&#10;In the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire&rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.&#10;&#10;Imperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You&rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you&rsquo;ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.&#10;&#10;As an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault.&#10;&#10;With these Imperial Assault and other Figure Packs, you'll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside iconic characters from the Star Wars saga. Boxed expansions add more heroes, imperial and mercenary groups, and totally new campaigns (see IA Community Wiki for a list), and the free Star Wars: Imperial Assault &#226;&#128;&#147; Legends of the Alliance app provides you with additional content to play in solo or co-op mode.&#10;&#10;",

We offer fully comprehensive streaming in music and threedee, news and sitcoms, classic movies and sensies. We cover it all. Ours is a brave new age, and as humanity hurtles into space and the future with an astonishing series of new advances every day, NBN and our affiliates are keeping pace, bringing you all the vid that's fit to view.&#10;&#10;Android: Netrunner is an asymmetrical Living Card Game for two players. Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners.&#10;&#10;Corporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with &quot;ice&quot;. These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation's virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.&#10;&#10;In turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It's not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort's defenses, there's no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing.&#10;&#10;The first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity.&#10;&#10;The Revised Core Set for Android: Netrunner released in late 2017 includes cards from the original Core Set released in 2012 as well as cards from the Genesis Cycle and Spin Cycle series of Data Packs. While the cards in this set have been released previously, the art on some of them is new.&#10;&#10;",

During the hunt, you'll encounter a series of stories in a &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; style journey through various events and encounters.

Delve deeper to find more valuable loot. Acquire cards for your deck and watch your thievish abilities grow.&#10;&#10;Be quick and be quiet. One false step and CLANK! Each careless sound draws the attention of the dragon, and each artifact stolen increases its rage. You can enjoy your plunder only if you make it out of the depths alive!&#10;&#10;Clank! is a deck-building game. Each player has their own deck, and building yours up is part of playing the game. You start each of your turns with five cards in your hand, and you'll play them all in any order you choose. Most cards will generate resources, of which there are three different kinds:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Skill, which is used to acquire new cards for your deck.&#10;    Swords, which are used to fight the monsters that infest the dungeon.&#10;    Boots, which are used to move around the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;Every time you acquire a new card, you put it face up in your discard pile. Whenever you need to draw a card and find your deck empty, you shuffle your discard pile and turn it face down to form a new deck. With each shuffle, your newest cards become part of a bigger and better deck! Each player starts with the same cards in their deck, but they&rsquo;ll acquire different cards during their turns. Because cards can do many different things, each player&rsquo;s deck (and strategy) will become more and more different as the game unfolds.&#10;&#10;During the game, you have two goals:&#10;&#10;    Retrieve an Artifact token and escape the dragon by returning to the place you started, outside of the dungeon.&#10;    Accumulate enough points with your Artifact and other loot to beat out your opponents and earn the title of Greatest Thief in the Realm!&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Create more fields for your livestock, buildings, or future crops; after that, you can decide whether to house animals or cultivate a forest for timber. Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to take up some flax farming for yourself, or diversify and try out a little bit of everything.&#10;&#10;Tools of the Trade&#10;At the outset of each half year, you&rsquo;ll choose how you&rsquo;d like to spend that time working.

Taking stock of your progress differs depending on the season. You may milk your existing livestock or care for a bunch of newborn animals. You could harvest your flax in the fall, and sheer your sheep in spring.

Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.&#10;&#10;",

Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species. &#10;Dominant Species is a game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth. &#10;Each player will assume the role of one of six major animal classes&mdash;mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid, or insect. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won&rsquo;t last: It is indeed &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;.&#10;Through wily action pawn placement, players will strive to become dominant on as many different terrain tiles as possible in order to claim powerful card effects. Players will also want to propagate their individual species in order to earn victory points for their particular animal. Players will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration, and adaptation actions, among others. &#10;All of this eventually leads to the end game&mdash;the final ascent of the ice age&mdash;where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have his animal crowned the Dominant Species. &#10;But somebody better become dominant quickly, because it&rsquo;s getting mighty cold...&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;The large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of earth as it might have appeared a thousand centuries ago. The smaller tundra tiles will be placed atop the larger tiles&mdash;converting them into tundra in the process&mdash;as the ice age encroaches.&#10;The cylindrical action pawns (or &quot;AP&quot;s) drive the game. Each AP will allow a player to perform the various actions that can be taken, such as speciation, environmental change, migration, or glaciation. After being placed on the action display during the Planning Phase, an AP will trigger that particular action for the owning player during the Execution Phase.&#10;Generally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal&rsquo;s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents&rsquo;&mdash;hopefully collecting valuable victory points (or &quot;VP&quot;s) along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.&#10;Throughout the game, species cubes will be added to, moved about in, and removed from the tiles in play (the &quot;earth&quot;). Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth. &#10;When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile&mdash;after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins.&#10;&#10;",

After a long and grueling journey that led through Jerusalem and Mesopotamia and over the &quot;Silk Road&quot;, they reached the court of Kublai Khan in 1275.&#10;&#10;In The Voyages of Marco Polo, players recreate this journey, with each player having a different character from history with a special power in the game. The game is played over five rounds. Each round, the players roll their five personal dice and take turns performing actions by placing their dice onto the board. Players may choose from a variety of actions, each require the use of one or more dice: collecting resources or money, acquiring contracts, traveling on the map or using a special action granted by a city. When traveling, each player begins at Venice and can decide between several routes eastward, all the way to Beijing. When a player stops at a city, they place a trading post there, giving them access to extra actions or resources for the rest of the game. The higher the value of the dice used for an action, the better the options that may be chosen, but also the more money the player must pay if an opponent has already chosen the same action.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, the game ends with players receiving extra victory points for having trading posts in Beijing, fulfilling the most contracts, and having trading posts in the cities on secret goal cards that each player gets at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;This game should not be confused with Marco Polo Expedition, which has the same German title.&#10;&#10;",

Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.&#10;&#10;7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.&#10;&#10;In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how her choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.&#10;&#10;Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3&ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.&#10;&#10;",

Each game, the companion app randomly selects an arrangement of objects and a location for Planet X following predefined logic rules.&#10;&#10;Each round, as the earth travels around the sun, players use the app to perform scans and attend conferences. As they gain information about the location of the objects, they mark that information on their deduction sheets.

Once a player believes they know its location and the objects on either side of it, they use the app to conduct a search. The game ends when a player successfully locates Planet X, and all players have a final chance to score some additional points.&#10;&#10;The Search for Planet X captures the thrill of discovery, the puzzle-y nature of astronomical investigation, and the competition inherent in the scientific process.

To that end, you draft caballeros (knights) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had there into the region you secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande and in the region containing the king.&#10;&#10;",

The Capitalist class controls the companies. The Middle class combines elements from both the Working class and the Capitalist. It has workers who can work in the Capitalist's companies but it can also build companies of its own, yet smaller. Finally the State is trying to keep everyone happy, providing benefits and subsidies when needed but trying also to maintain a steady income through taxes to avoid going into debt.&#10;&#10;While players have their own separate goals, they are all limited by a series of policies that affect most of their actions, like Taxation, Labor Market, Foreign Trade etc. Voting on those policies and using their influence to change them is also very important.

Starvation, sickness, violent weather, and random incidents all conspire to end your journey. Guardian Menhirs, that ensured safe travel throughout the realm, are slowly going dark turning simple logistics into an involving puzzle. To overcome these challenges, your character develops along several con&#239;&#172;&#130;icting lines, such as Brutality / Empathy or Practicality / Spirituality. These traits unlock a rich choice of mutually exclusive skills and lead to di&#239;&#172;&#128;erent deck-building strategies, making character advancement meaningful and deep.&#10;&#10;The character you develop is going to be tested during dozens of combat and non-combat encounters.

Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.&#10;&#10;After the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth. They face the threat of Cylon attack from without, and treachery and crisis from within. Humanity must work together if they are to have any hope of survival&hellip;but how can they, when any of them may, in fact, be a Cylon agent?&#10;&#10;Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is a semi-cooperative game for 3-6 players ages 10 and up that can be played in 2-3 hours. Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities. Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don't match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up. If players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game. But if the Cylon players reveal themselves at the right moment and bring down Galactica, the Humans have lost.&#10;&#10;Official Site, Rules &amp; FAQ: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=18&amp;esem=4&#10;Unofficial FAQ for really tricky questions: http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Battlestar_Galactica_FAQ&#10;&#10;",

As royal architects, players compete to impress their King and maintain their noble status by constructing various landmarks throughout his newly appointed domain. Players need to collect raw materials, hire apprentices, and keep a watchful eye on their workforce. These are treacherous times, and rival architects will stop at nothing to slow your progress. Will you remain virtuous, or be found in the company of thieves and black marketeers?&#10;&#10;The aim of Architects of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by constructing various buildings and advancing work on the Archbishop's cathedral. Throughout the game, players need to make a lot of moral decisions. However, only at game's end will their virtue be judged. A few underhand deals here and there might not seem like much, but fall too far and you will be punished. The game ends once a set number of constructions have been completed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

In the first round, each team does the following: One team member takes a code card that shows three of the digits 1-4 in some order, e.g., 4-2-1. They then give a coded message that their teammates must use to guess this code. For example, if the team's four words are &quot;pig&quot;, &quot;candy&quot;, &quot;tent&quot;, and &quot;son&quot;, then I might say &quot;Sam-striped-pink&quot; and hope that my teammates can correctly map those words to 4-2-1. If they guess correctly, great; if not, we receive a black mark of failure.&#10;&#10;Starting in the second round, a member of each team must again give a clue about their words to match a numbered code. If I get 2-4-3, I might now say, &quot;sucker-prince-stake&quot;. The other team then attempts to guess our numbered code. If they're correct, they receive a white mark of success; if not, then my team must guess the number correctly or take a black mark of failure. (Guessing correctly does nothing except avoid failure and give the opposing team information about what our hidden words might be.)&#10;&#10;The rounds continue until a team collects either its second white mark (winning the game) or its second black mark (losing the game). Games typically last between 4-7 rounds. If neither team has won after eight rounds, then each team must attempt to guess the other team's words; whichever team guesses more words correctly wins.&#10;&#10;",

      description: "Inis is a game deeply rooted in Celtic history and lore in which players win by being elected King of the Island (Inis). Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Leadership: Be the leader &mdash; i.e., have more clan figures than any other player &mdash; of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.&#10;     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.&#10;     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six sanctuaries.&#10;&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed player will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.&#10;&#10;",

They are striving for fortune and fame in a competition hosted by a legendary magician, looking for a successor worthy of the mighty Trickerion Stone, which is fabled to grant supernatural power to its owner.&#10;&#10;Using worker placement and simultaneous action selection mechanisms, the Illusionists and their teams of helpers &mdash; the Engineer, the Assistant, the Manager, and a handful of Apprentices &ndash; obtain blueprints and components for increasingly complex magic tricks, expand the team and set up performances by visiting the Downtown, Dark Alley, Market Row and Theater locations on the main game board depicting a late 19th century cityscape.&#10;&#10;The tricks are stored and prepared on the Magician's own Workshop game board, while the performances themselves take place at the Theater in the form of a tile placement mini-game with lots of player interaction. The performances yield Fame points and Coins to their owners based on the tricks they consist of. Fame points have multiple uses, but they also serve as a win condition - After turn 7, when the last Performance card is revealed, the game ends and the illusionist with the most Fame points wins.&#10;&#10;The game offers 48 different Tricks to be learned from the Optical, Spiritual, Mechanical and Escape categories, over 90 character abilities, and 40 Special Assignment cards that influence the actions taken at the various game locations. The base game can be expanded with two optional rule modules to add further strategic depth to the game.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Dark Alley&quot; expansion included in the base game adds a new location to the game.

Each player starts the game with a &quot;home&quot; tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.&#10;&#10;In spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.&#10;&#10;Keyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game. Throughout the game, players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers.&#10;&#10;Keyflower, a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale, is the seventh game in the &quot;Key&quot; series from R&amp;D Games set in the medieval &quot;Key&quot; land.&#10;&#10;",

Scalable from 10 to 50 models per side, now you can vie for the throne of the Ancient King!&#10;&#10;&quot;With a unique one roll resolution system and an active chain of command, you'll feel like you're actually in charge of an army without being bogged down in tedious tracking.  Combat is fast, fluid, furious and tactical - your decisions will matter on the battlefield!&quot;&#10;&#10;There are five initial factions:&#10;&#10;House Teknes&#10;&#10;The armies of Teknes are some of the most well rounded troops. They are able to move from a defensive posture to attack in the blink of an eye. Both the Union Workers and Defender Linemen punish their enemies for attacking them. Their specialists and characters often employ lightning and magical wards to bolster their own defensive lines. No army attacks Teknes battle lines without expecting heavy casualties.&#10;&#10;House Shael Han&#10;&#10;The Shael Han fighting style is a mystery to all of their enemies and for good reason. The Legionaries are some of the weakest troops on the field by themselves, however whenever they are close by a specialist they become a force to reckon with. The Wrath led by their Big Sister are experts in engaging more than one enemy at a time. The true strength of any Shael Han army are their specialists, vulnerable by themselves but extremely powerful when working together they can cause a symphony of destruction on any battlefield.&#10;&#10;House Nasier&#10;&#10;Nasier love nothing more than to see their enemies wither in their path. The Nasier Ashmen charge is legendary and few enemies have ever lived to tell the tale. They&rsquo;re often supported by the Pelagarth who revel in combat and despite their lack of armor, cause more casualties then they take. The specialists of Nasier prefer to use flames to punish their enemies. One of the most aggressive armies, their zeal for reinstating the Efrenti presence leads them to wrought destruction throughout the continent.&#10;&#10;House Hadross&#10;&#10;As the most defensive army in the game, Hadross units become stronger both offensively and defensively as the game progresses. With each Deepmen lost, enemy models receive Resonate markers, which makes them easier to kill. Meanwhile the slower yet deadlier Sevridan keep enemy units from fleeing the battlefield. The Hadross specialists enhance the battlefield adding water elements to increase movement.&#10;&#10;House Goritsi&#10;&#10;Combining the fastest movement in the game with some of the strongest attacks Goritsi prefer hit and run tactics to conventional warfare. Players can employ the blazing speed of the Skorza to flank their enemies while their lethal Zeti hold the line. The terrible Blood Engine consumes the flesh of his enemies to heal his wounds. If you prefer high mobility armies and attacking first, Goritsi is the army for you.&#10;&#10;The models are in plastic, with weapons in polystyrene so that they keep nice straight edges on spear shafts, handles, and large sword blades etc.&#10;&#10;",

One 24-pages rulebook with 6-pages of historical commentary by the designer and 1-page of Terrain Effects Chart included (hence the rules actually occupy only 17 pages).&#10;&#10;The Six Days of Glory is an operational Napoleonic game. 3 short scenarios are included, covering the campaigns in three separate battles at three cities along the road to Paris: Champaubert (9~10 Feb); Montmirail (11~12 Feb) and Vauchamps (13~14 Feb), each playable in less than 1 &frac12; hours. A campaign scenario linking all three (9~14 Feb) battles from the beginning to the end can be completed in less than 3 hours.&#10;&#10;The French moves first in all scenarios.

      description: "One of the most innovative additions to the boys action aisle is ATTACKTIX.  Launching with Star Wars: Episode III toys, ATTACKTIX is a battle figure game that combines great action figures with kinetic battling features.&#10;&#10;Each figure comes on a base that contains all of the information that a trading card might include, such as speed, defense, point value and special powers unique to that character.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is simple: be the last one standing; but beyond that there are nearly unlimited strategies.  To begin, kids select how many points each squad should start out with, pick their squads and put them into formation.  On each turn, kids will move their figures across the table (counting distance using a patented clicking wheel in the base), and then attack with features like slashing light sabers, firing projectiles and others.  When the figures are knocked over, their special powers come into play and influence the game.  For example, granting another one of your figures an attack or bringing back a figure who may have been previously defeated.&#10;&#10;This version is based on characters in the Star Wars Universe.&#10;&#10;There are multiple themes in the Attacktix series of games.&#10;&#10;",

      description: "White Eagle Defiant, the follow-up game to the bestselling Brave Little Belgium, recreates the German, Slovak and Soviet invasion of Poland in September and October 1939 that marked the beginning of the Second World War.  Germany and its Slovakian ally began the invasion on September 1, 1939; the Soviet Union followed suit on the 17th.  Known in Poland as the September Campaign and in Germany by the codename Fall Weiss (Case White), the campaign ended on October 6, 1939 with Germany and the Soviet Union splitting the country in two.&#10;  &#10;In White Eagle Defiant, one player controls the Germans, Slovaks and Soviets (simplified as the Germans in the game) while the other player commands the Poles.  The German objective is to gain control of Warsaw and other designated Victory cities while preventing Polish forces from destroying their forts in East Prussia and recapturing Victory cities.  If the German player does so in less time than the historical campaign, they win the game.  Anything less is a draw or a win for the Polish player.&#10;&#10;This quick-playing wargame employs very similar mechanics as Brave Little Belgium, but with a modest increase in complexity. The game uses a point-to-point map and a chit pull mechanism to simulate the campaign, with each turn representing four days. Random event chits are included to add variety and excitement to the game, reflecting the weapons (such as armored trains and aerial bombardment) used at the beginning of World War II.  The combat system, while still simple, is enhanced to better simulate mechanized warfare, as well as the use of combined forces (players can bring forces from adjacent spaces into an attack, creating primary and secondary combat groups).&#10;&#10;Other new features in White Eagle Defiant include Panzers for the Germans (which can roll two dice instead of one) and cavalry for the Poles (which can roll a &ldquo;first shot&rdquo; at the beginning of a combat round). A Victory Point track allows for variable entry of Soviet forces (depending on the success of the German player in capturing Victory cities), as well as the possibility of the Allies launching an attack in the West (if the German player fails to do well in capturing Victory cities). Finally, a &ldquo;blitzkrieg breakdown&rdquo; track is used by the German player; if the turn ends before both German army group chits are pulled, the German player may elect to activate a group, but possibly suffer a &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; while doing so &ndash; and if five such breakdowns occur, the German player automatically loses the game.&#10;&#10;Players who enjoyed Brave Little Belgium will find that White Eagle Defiant offers the same tense play for both sides, while presenting new challenges that reflect the dawn of the blitzkrieg era.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

There are always more fledgling civilizations ready to rise to the heights of power and culture, invent new technologies, and usher in a new millennium.&#10;&#10;Deep Future is a card-driven board game for 1-3 players of empire and innovation spanning the rise and fall of the countless worlds of the galaxy.

Each game will see the addition of new cards, which represent the worlds in the galaxy, the techs invented, and the lasting impact of previous civilizations.&#10;&#10;The rules include tables and guidelines for creating new cards as needed, and this makes every copy of Deep Future an evolving galaxy. In addition, it means that each game inherits all components added or changed in the previous games.

      description: "From the Developer's Website:&#10;&#10;Bushido is an oriental fantasy tabletop miniature battle game for two players. Each player commands a force of no more than a handful of individuals, represented by 32mm metal miniatures. These forces meet on the battlefield and the commanders (the players, that is) try to outwit, outfight and outlive the opposing force and fulfil their battle objectives while denying the enemy theirs. If you have played tabletop miniature games before, Bushido falls into the &lsquo;skirmish game&rsquo; category: all miniatures represent individuals and your force consists of a small group of unique characters rather than a big faceless army. A game of Bushido is fast-moving, flexible and filled with strategizing, counter-strategizing and counter-counter-strategizing. Your tactical acumen is important, but as dice add an element of randomness, so too is your ability to think on your feet. A typical game of Bushido takes between one and two hours to play - more if you are new to the game, less if you are a seasoned veteran.&#10;&#10;",

The board was recreated using photo art and new character art was used. Only the base game was produced.&#10;&#10;",

Rules for special actions.&#10;&#10;Based on the principle of simultaneous execution, or simply &quot;WE GO&quot;, a hybrid system of turns and &quot;real time&quot;. The players must activate unit leaders to perform many actions (fire, assault, move, coordinate, etc). A turn ends when both players have completed all their activations. The scale is platoon level with units &#10;representing groups of between 30 and 40 soldiers, weapons units represents groups of 3-4 weapons and their accompanying crews (20-25 soldiers), and the AFVs/Transports representing groups of 3 to 5 vehicles and their corresponding crews.

To do so, the muse must eliminate their virtuoso's rivals by levying doubts and dreads upon them until they are driven insane...or worse.&#10;&#10;Bemused is not a social deduction game.  Although there are elements of deductive reasoning, Bemused is a social interaction experience that encourages shameless table talk, bluffing, and deal-making as players seek to maximize their scores in a &quot;take that&quot; environment.  Bemused is best described as a strategic &quot;ruin your rivals&quot; game with hidden goals and asymmetric player powers.  It is also a much deeper strategy game than it first appears.&#10;&#10;Each player has a virtuoso card that designates their human prot&eacute;g&eacute; and a hand of doubt and dread cards.  Each turn, the player draws two doubt cards for their hand, places a doubt or dread card from their hand onto a virtuoso card, then discards a card from their hand. In some cases, a player may play two doubt cards from their hand, but this action permanently reduces their hand size. Each virtuoso has an ability that their muse may use, such as change a dread to a doubt or move a doubt from one virtuoso to another.  Scheming, negotiating, and table talk are encouraged!&#10;&#10;When a virtuoso is saddled with a combined total of five doubt and/or dread cards, the virtuoso is driven insane. An insane virtuoso still gets their turn and may still win the game, but their options for which cards they may play on their turn is limited by their insanity. If an insane virtuoso has more dread than doubts, that virtuoso dies and becomes a fantasma that haunts the remaining living virtuosos. A fantasma may still win the game!&#10;&#10;Each muse's prot&eacute;g&eacute; also has a gemina, a secret virtuoso in the game that holds a psychic link with their prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and a secret that describes how their prot&eacute;g&eacute; feels about their gemina, and how the player's score will be affected by the state of their prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s gemina when the game ends (e.g., the player may gain points if their virtuoso's gemina is not insane at the end of the game).  Once a virtuoso's gemina is revealed, a player may use the gemina's ability as well as their prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s ability!  A player may also reveal and use their virtuoso's gemina for a price... but whenever a virtuoso goes insane, their gemina automatically flips over and can have severe consequences for play...&#10;&#10;",

The games adhere closely to the highly successful BAR rules system. The major change lies in the halving of the strength point ratio so that 1 point equals 50 men, 25 horsemen, or 1 cannon, accommodating the smaller battles and units of North America. There is a noted lack of cavalry in both battles. The counters are in the same style as the other BAR games, but with some interesting variations (e.g., rifle frocks). Brandywine (three maps) has 4 scenarios: Knyphausen's attack at Chads Ford, Cornwallis' attack at Birmingham Meeting House (both one mappers), Howe's historical plan (comprising both Knyphausen's and Cornwallis' attacks), and an optional Howe plan. The latter scenario will allow the British player to select alternative schemes of maneuver to attack the Americans.  Washington, in turn, has the ability to gain intelligence on the British movements      (both true and false information) and possibly readjust his force. Germantown (two maps) has 2 scenarios. They vary based on whether or not the Americans are required to seize the Chew House.&#10;&#10;",

Before you have time to think, multi-ball starts placing you and the other players in competition to score the various pop bumpers, drop targets and other playfield devices. You and the other pinballs have only a short time to score the most points and complete the various combos for bonuses before it's all over and you inevitably drain.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt ten cards each of which represents a pinball playfield device. Each turn the players all select one card from their hand and one is added from the draw deck. These cards are placed face up in the center of the table and are the playfield devices that pinballs can steer towards and try to score this round. Starting with the first player, each player has three options. They may place a bid on a playfield device (Steer towards it), spend one or more control tokens to increase the speed of their pinball and they may purchase a playfield card from the discard pile. They many do any or all of these options or pass and do none. The highest bidders on each device takes their card and, assuming they meet the speed requirements to complete the device, they score it. Anyone who did not bid on a device starting with the first player selects one of the remaining devices. Pinballs must be going the speed listed on the device they get or greater to score it. If they are not, it is not scored and they still lose speed according to the device. Devices that are scored affect speed and can cause your pinball to speed up or slow down depending on the device. Besides scoring devices and trying not to drain by hitting a speed of zero, players are all competing to finish various combinations which score additional bonuses. At the end of ten rounds, the player that scored the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Also, players may block each others' progress as in Parchisi.  Senet sets are usually constructed from various woods and are often quite beautiful.  Senet is one of the oldest boardgames but unfortunately it fell out of use for a few thousand years and no ancient rules set has been discovered.  Undoubtably another tragic loss resulting from the Library of Alexandria burning to the ground.  As a result scholars has made several educated guesses as to the rules.

For example, the Palace lets you see all bids before placing yours and the Heir lets you claim an unclaimed dynasty card.&#10;&#10;From back of the box:&#10;&#10;Following the collapse of the Han Dynasty, warlords backed rival claimants to the Chinese Throne, while others sought influence among the merchants, nobles, farmers, and bureaucrats.&#10;&#10;Each round, players play Bid Cards to claim Dynasty Cards and take control of the Emperor, Heir, Palace, Market, and Harvest.  However, the heavens in the guise of a Celestial Dragon, can disrupt the best laid plans.  The game ends as the Emperor dies and whoever gains the most influence will ascen the throne.&#10;&#10;",

Otherwise you're piddling away time spent chasing individual crabs, which is hardly worth the bother. The fishermen who nets the most valuable haul wins the game.&#10;&#10;Set-up in Kraby differs depending on the number of players, with 80 or 120 tiles in play, the game board being 9x9 or 11x11, and the number of colored crab figures being 10, 12 or 15. Each player starts by secretly drawing six crab tiles (which come in four colors with two players and five colors otherwise) and placing them behind their screen. On a turn, a player chooses one tile and enters it from any side of the game board, sliding it in the row or column until it hits the island at the center of the board or another tile in play. (A move that would slide a tile off the board or create an impossible-to-fill space is illegal.) The player then draws a new tile and places it behind his screen.&#10;&#10;A player then has the option of placing one of the colored crab figures in his ship's hold. Each ship has three holds, with a scoring multiplier of x1, x2 or x3. A player can claim a color only once and cannot place it on the same multipler as another player. In a four-player game, a player can claim only two figures.)&#10;&#10;The game ends once the final tile has been placed and the game board filled. Each group of crabs in the same color, with orthogonally adjacent crabs belonging to the same group, is worth -1 to 5 points depending on its size. Once the value of a color is determined, each player scoring this color multiplies this value &ndash; which might be negative &ndash; by the multipliers showing on his ship's hold.

Players work through these 3 phases, in this order. Each phase is explained in greater detail in the rulebook. But, generally, players will:&#10;&#10;- BID: Starting with the first player and continuing clockwise, each player must place 1 coin of their choice face-down onto one of the bid spots on the playmat. Each bid spot targets 2 cards within the same row or column.&#10;&#10;- COLLECT: Players flip their coins and determine who won each card. Determine the winner for each card using this order:&#10;  1. The only bidder&#10;  2. Highest bidder&#10;  3.If tied, the player whose coin is closest to the card&#10;  4. If still tied, the player whose coin is on the long edge of the card&#10;Then each player collects 2 cards total to their hands &mdash; taking from the Market and/or the red deck.&#10;&#10;- BUILD: Players use as many cards as they want from their hands to build Monuments. To add to a Monument, slide an appropriate card under the previous one, revealing the section that continues the Monument. Once a Monument has all its required sections, it is &ldquo;complete.&rdquo; Buddhas are considered complete immediately after they are built. When you complete a Monument, immediately score points for completing it&#10;&#10;The game has 8 rounds. After every 4 rounds, each player will only have 1 coin left. When this happens, players either convert their last coin to points or buy 1 discarded card.&#10;&#10;MISSIONS: Players may complete various objectives for bonus points. Each Mission contains 4 objectives&mdash;to complete a Buddha, a Shrine, a Stupa, and/or a Pagoda with sections matching the color(s) shown on the Mission.&#10;&#10;GAME END:&#10;- Discard all cards left in your hands and discard piles.&#10;- Score points for the topmost card of any incomplete Monuments.&#10;- Score color bonuses (if any) for your completed Monument.&#10;&#10;WINNING: The player with the most points becomes the most well-respected architect, and therefore wins the game!&#10;&#10;Reviving Kathmandu is the second game in the Lemery Games Globetrotter Game Series, after Chili Mafia.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

      description: "From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Covering the great battles of Erwin Rommel from 1941 to 1943, as he fought his way back and forth across the deserts of North Africa. LNA uses cards to represent the military units, supply convoys and objectives of the historic campaign. To win, you must consider your units' combat power and maneuver options as well as their supply situation. The game features: the Afrika Korps, Tobruk, the Desert Rats, Malta, anti-tank guns, resupply from Europe, minefields and more. LNA is based around a new combat system that makes maneuver and planning as important as brute force. That approach is faithful to the historic events, in which smaller forces were often able to defeat and rout larger ones by using better tactics and planning. In LNA, battles can be won not only by overwhelming the enemy with firepower, but also by out-thinking and bluffing him. The dynamic game system puts you in charge of one of the most famous theaters of WWII.&#10;&#10;Lightning Game Series&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player moves one piece in a direction matching one of the movement arrows on that piece, with the maximum distance moved being equal to the number of arrows on that piece.&#10;&#10;The blue pivot spaces on the game board allow for tricky plays. If a player moves a piece onto one of these spaces, he can rotate that piece, allowing it to move in any direction for the remainder of its movement. For example, if you're one space away from a pivot with a piece that has three arrows (and is pointing at the pivot), you can move one space onto the pivot, rotate your piece, then move the remaining one or two spaces in any direction now indicated by the piece's arrows.&#10;&#10;You capture movement arrows two ways:&#10;&#10;&bull; Land on an opponent's piece, and you remove a movement arrow of your choice, then place that piece on an unoccupied blue pivot space in any direction you wish.&#10;&bull; Jump an opponent's piece, then remove the one or two arrows on that piece that are parallel to your direction of movement.&#10;&#10;You win by being the first player to capture 17 of your opponent's movement arrows.&#10;&#10;",

      description: "This game evolved from (or alongside) Fox &amp; Geese and seems to have appeared first in Germany at least as early as 1803, where it has been known as Belagerungsspiel (Siege Game) or Festungsspiel (Fortress Game.)  In English speaking countries it was published as Siege, or German Tactics. In France it was published in 1855 as Assault. In Italy it is called Assalto, Assalto al Fortino, Assedio di Sebastopoli, and Citadel. Since it is played on essentially a Fox &amp; Geese board with additional markings and pieces, it was often included in a set with rules for Fox &amp; Geese and Solitaire.  The markings outline one nine-point side of the cross as a distinct fortress or castle, typically in a different color from the rest of the board's points.  Also, the horizontal lines of the board are in a different color than the rest, but for the few closest to the fortress.  This is to indicate where the attacker may not move; in some editions these markings are absent and instead simply described by the player's rules of movement.&#10;&#10;The defending player has two pieces in the fortress, either on specific starting points or anywhere the player chooses, depending on the included rules.  The other player has twenty-four pieces, one on each of the board's remaining points.  The goal for the attacking player is to occupy all nine of the fortress points with one of his pieces.  The goal for the defending player is to reduce the attacker to eight pieces, thereby preventing occupation of the fortress.&#10;&#10;Attackers may move along the vertical or diagonal lines towards the fortress only, except on the few marked horizontal lines near the fortress.  They may not jump or capture any pieces.  The defenders may move in any direction along any line, and may capture (remove from the board) an attacker's piece by jumping over it to a vacant opposite point.&#10;&#10;Siege evolved further into a larger edition with a sixty-seven point board, seventeen points for the fortress (and three defending pieces) and fifty points for the attackers.  Sometimes published in Germany and continental Europe as Neues Belagerungsspiel (New Siege Game) or Grosses Festungs-Spiel (Big Fortress Game,) it was known in English-speaking countries as The Royal Garrison Game and has been published under many other names since then.&#10;&#10;Examples of books or game compilations containing Asalto, &#10;e.g :  &#10;'The Boardgame Book&#10;'The Book of Classic Board Games&#10;or&#10;'Medito&#10;&#10;",

      description: "Another in the line of very small card games by Reinhard Staupe. The deck consists of four suits of cards numbered 1 to 7. The 1s have three stars, the 2s have two stars and all other cards have one star. Players start with 150 points (which serves as a starting score and a money pool for bidding). For 2 players, use 16 cards, for 3 players use 21 cards, for 4 players use 24 cards (so that players do not know which cards are in play) and these are auctioned off one at a time. Bid increments must be at least as great as the number of the card being auctioned but can be more - i.e. while bidding on a card with the number 4, a bid of four would require a bid of 8 or more from the next bidder). The first bid can be lower, the same or higher than the number of the card.  Bidding goes clockwise around the table.  First bid also moves clockwise around the table. When all cards have been auctioned, suits are scored separately for each player by adding the card numbers and multiplying that figure by the total number of stars in the suit. Scores for each suit are added to any remaining points from a players' starting pool (points remaining from the original pool of 150) to determine the final score. Comeback was nominated for Spiel des Jahres in Germany in 1997.&#10;&#10;",

Misreading the situation, the hunter became the hunted when the main Austrian army in Italy, over 30,000 soldiers with 100 cannon, advanced against Napoleon's 18,000 troops and dozen cannon on the Marengo plain. Perceiving the danger, Napoleon urgently summoned his reserves and wayward detachments, bringing his strength up to near parity with the Austrians. It was just enough to forge victory from a potential disaster.&#10;&#10;Marengo utilizes the all-new Musket &amp; Saber combat system, which provides a simple yet accurate portrayal of Napoleonic warfare. The combat system is intuitive, including all the details that characterized battle during the Napoleonic era while also simulating the unique aspects of 19th century warfare. Units can become weakened and rout; attackers can pursue, and the fortunes of war can intervene at any time. Cavalry can rip open enemy lines and shred fleeing units, while reserves must be ready to plug holes or secure the line of retreat.&#10;&#10;A new Combat Results Table emphasizes playability while also simulating the lethality of musket and bayonet engagements of that era. Leaders accelerate the action, replicating the importance of their presence during battle. Supply trains and headquarters help armies function smoothly, forcing players to protect their logistical base. Winning a battle will depend on deployment, maneuver and massing firepower, as well as understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each particular army.&#10;&#10;",

This game won first prize.&#10;&#10;The great totem pole competition is being held among the Tenakee Indians. Those taking part want to show off the most beautiful and valuable totem poles. But the poles are only scored when it gets a point, so that the Indians like to annoy each other by climbing up and putting points on poles. At the same time, the squaws are using the event to search for a man. Which carver is brave enough to climb the high totem poles?&#10;&#10;",

In this chaotic universe, each player is a young star trying to control the galaxy where they live, and prevent the other players from seizing power. Why on earth would you dream of controlling the chaos and fighting against other stars? Well, to become the brightest and the most powerful star of the galaxy! Do not miss your chance, show the other stars how badass you are!&#10;&#10;Playing the Game: To start playing Entropia, deal three cards to each player and place the deck on the centre. One of the players goes first and the game starts. During your turn, you can choose and perform only one action, which can consist in drawing a card from the deck or playing one of your cards, then the turn passes to the next player in rotation.&#10;&#10;All cards in the deck stand for a planet and you can use them to perform different actions: for example, you can use your card to attract planets with your gravity by putting the card on the board in front of you (using the keyword Attract), you can convert the mass of a planet into pure energy (using the keyword Fuse) in order to draw new cards from the deck, play an extra card during your turn or scupper the strategies of the other players by destroying their planets. Moreover, you can also discard your cards when your planets have the same mass of your adversary&rsquo;s planets (using the keyword Annihilate) in order to stop other players heading all the way to the winning.&#10;&#10;Since the first person to control four planets wins the game, every player should develop unique strategies to destroy other players&rsquo; cards and conquer the four planets as fast as she/he can. Even though the game looks simple and easy to play at first glance, you will need to devise strategies to control overpowered cards and use them wisely. It&rsquo;s up to you whether you want to greedily take over all the four planets or slowly destroy your enemies&rsquo; resources: there are more methods and strategies you can use to win over the other players, so come and discover them while playing. You need to sharpen your weapons and grit your teeth to be the next champion of Entropia!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

With the help of their special equipment, they will compete with each other to gather the most treasure from this expedition &ndash; but watch out for The Guardian! He awakes from the darkness of the ruins to fulfill his mission, to chase all intruders and throw them out with a curse!&#10;&#10;In Pyramid Raiders, players lay down action tiles to move and collect treasure tokens on a hexagonal map. Besides providing a number for movement, action tiles will also effect The Guardian in different ways, such as rotate him to face another direction or make him move faster. Used action tiles will stay on board, and will be returned to hand only every five turns when they are all used.&#10;&#10;The Guardian's movement is guided by a set of rules and does not need a player to act as the GM. Each turn after all players have finished their moves, roll a die to move The Guardian, then move it extra spaces depending on the action tiles played this turn.&#10;&#10;At the start of each game, randomly place 49 treasure tokens of seven kinds on the map. Players score by collecting tokens of different colors, or by specializing in only one or two colors. Twelve wooden tokens are placed on the map as obstacles, and can be placed in different layouts to change the difficulty of the game. Ten item tiles are included to provide rule-bending effects for players. And for those who are up for the challenge, two extra Line of Sight tokens will let The Guardian literally grow eyes on his back, making it even harder to escape &ndash; or easier to trap other players depending on your point of view...&#10;&#10;",

      description: "'Eden is the dream of making arid land fertile. At the outset, the board is a desert. Players play irrigation cards that allow them to place plant tiles in the desert, thus bringing life and fertility to it. As the desert grows, cultivation cards may develop the plant tiles further, making them more valuable and bringing players much manna. The player who first gets tiles valued at 20 &quot;fertility points&quot; on the board wins. But watch out! As the desert blooms competition for the land increases, and other players will try to take your most fertile land away.&#10;&#10;The game play in Eden is simple. Either play one or two irrigation cards to develop areas of desert (i.e. place tiles on the board), or play a cultivation card to increase the value of areas already on the board (i.e. replace existing tiles with more valuable ones, at a cost), or pass. Conflict enters the game when a player places a new tile on the board next to an opponent's existing tile. Then a challenge may be made by the player placing the tile. Manna, the currency in the game, is used in the challenge, which takes the form of a bidding war. Bids, which must be divisible by 5, are always increased. But what the winning bidder actually must pay is the bid MULTIPLIED by the value of the tiles that would be gained. In the case of the challenger, the winning bid would be the bid itself times the value of the tiles sought. In the case of the defender, the winning bid would be the bid itself times the value of the tiles the defender is using in what in effect is an attack. Bids keep rising until one player is unwilling, or unable, to meet the final cost of a bid. The loser forfeits all the tiles involved in the conflict, but gains the value of that land (according to the bid) in manna from the other player.&#10;&#10;",

      description: "The 16th century, the age of renaissance. Sailing and maritime trade are flourishing, vast fleets belonging to shipping companies are crossing the seas around the world. There is fierce competition for the available commodities which must be delivered to harbors. The shortest sea route may not be the easiest one. To achieve your goal in becoming the best captain, you need to find the best routes, deliver your goods to the harbor at the right moment and should not think twice to go raiding a little at times. Your portolan chart, a navigation map lies already in front of you, the crew is awaiting your order, and the race is just about to begin.&#10;&#10;In Portolano, each players controls a ship at sea. With each step you move your ship to the next map tile (map consists of tiles randomly drawn at the beginning of the game). If this is a sea tile, the player can pick one resource (3 different goods or cannons) available on the island. Each sea tile allows for one additional special action. The most important one is ship building, letting players upgrade their ships, extend their cargo bay, increase their speed, or attacking power in battle.&#10;&#10;Other possible actions include e.g. trading goods (change them to other goods or rum). Once you move to a harbor, you sell the goods collected on the islands to get coins (each harbor has differing needs for products). The more goods you can sell in one go, the  more coins you will get.&#10;&#10;The players plan their next moves simultaneously, without knowing the plans of others. Therefore it may happen that a player moves to sea tile, where the goods are already taken by other players or to a harbor, where the demands have already been satisfied.&#10;&#10;Once everybody has moved their ships in the round, the wind indicator will be spun, the new wind direction determines the next move of the pirates, who are also on the prowl at sea. After this, the movement phase ends. There is a battle after the movement phase if players and/or the pirate are positioned on the same/adjacent tiles. The fights use dice rolling, the winner steals goods/coins/rum from the loser.&#10;&#10;Rum is considered to be an important commodity as well, it &quot;fuels&rdquo; the crew to sail the ship according to your orders. If any player runs out of rum, the crew rebels and the ship can move only in the direction that the wind takes it until the rum stock is refilled. The costs of moving the ship in terms of rum depends on your movement compared with the wind direction (upwind, tailwind, crosswind).&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as any of the goods run out. The player who has the most coins wins the game (coins can be collected even at the end of the game by unlocking bonuses).&#10;&#10;",

Gain points during an opponent's turn and watch their good fortune become another path to your success.

The player with the most points at the end of the 3rd round wins.&#10;&#10;PLAYING A ROUND&#10;Players take turns rolling and resolving their dice individually.

Roll Dice&#10;Begin your turn by rolling your player dice and Power dice together.&#10;Each of your opponents rolls their Power dice only.&#10;2. Opponents Score&#10;Each of your opponents gains 1 point for each of their Power dice that matches BOTH 1 of their unlocked (faceup) ability cards AND at least 1 of your dice (either your player dice or Power dice).&#10;3. Use Unlocked Abilities&#10;Next, you (and only you) may use any number of your unlocked (faceup)ability cards, in any order.&#10;4. Unlock New Abilities&#10;After you use your abilities, add up the numbers on only your player dice to determine your player dice total (and apply any modifiers from unlocked ability cards if desired).&#10;Then choose a combination of your locked (facedown) ability cards that add up exactly to your player dice total, and flip each of them faceup to unlock it.&#10;You must choose a combination of cards that are ALL locked. For example, if your #1 card is already unlocked, you may not choose any combination of cards that include a 1 (regardless of what you rolled).&#10;If you have no combination of locked cards that add up to your player dice total, you may not unlock any new cards and are instead out of the round.&#10;After unlocking cards, your turn is over.&#10;&#10;There are 3 types of abilities:&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; Power Die Ability (#1-6): In order to use a Power die ability, you must roll the matching number on at least 1 of your Power dice.&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; Modify Player Dice Total (#7-9): Once you have unlocked one of these abilities, you may use it once per turn to modify your player dice total for unlocking new abilities (see Step 4). Do not change the die faces you rolled when modifying your total.&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; Extra Power Die (#10): Once you unlock your yellow Power die, you may roll it for the rest of the round.&#10;&#10;    1. Power Die: Gain points equal to 1 of your dice.&#10;    2. Power Die: Gain a reroll token.&#10;    3. Power Die: Steal 3 points from another player.&#10;    4. Power Die: Score 1 point for each of your locked cards.&#10;    5. Power Die: Score 1 point for each of your unlocked cards.&#10;    6. Power Die: Choose a player to lose half their points, rounded down.&#10;    7. You may subtract 1 from your roll.&#10;    8. You may add 1 to your roll.&#10;    9.

The first player to force their opponent to have to play out of bounds, wins. Every move is both offensive and defensive, making Quadefy very fun to play. The rules have been drafted so that there is always a winner, no ties, stalemates, or cat's games.

(Destination: Treasure Island) is formally a race game, but in fact you need to employ tactics to meet challenges, complete missions and earn victory points. Your decisions will largely influence your score, although elements of luck are also present in the game.&#10;&#10;2-4 pirate ships set to sea to reach Treasure Island ahead of the others. But being the first is not enough: the real winner will be the one who scores best in the various challenges on the way. &#10;The pirates (48 character cards) have certain skills of different strength which can be boosted by using the appropriate weapons and tools (24 weapon cards). The set of cards held by players in hand continuously changes as cards are played and replaced during actions. This determines the actual power of a player&rsquo;s crew when facing a particular challenge.  Playing the cards tactfully can earn considerable advantage and valuable treasures for players, which will improve their final score.&#10;&#10;The game starts with an empty board and a series of blank fields on the sea, leading to Treasure Island. As the ships move ahead, the board is gradually filled with event cards randomly drawn, all indicating an action. Players will gather and sell pearls, trade with weapons, spy out and occupy islands, collect treasures, complete various missions or even kidnap other&rsquo;s sailors.  Often they master their skills to compete against each other or fight the forces of nature.&#10;&#10;The winner will be the player who achieves the most victory points by sailing fast, completing missions and having a valuable collection of treasures.&#10;&#10;Description from the publisher:&#10;Ir&aacute;ny a Kincses Sziget!&#10;Verseng&eacute;s &eacute;s k&uuml;zdelem a tengeren&#10;&#10;Az Ir&aacute;ny a Kincses sziget! formailag egy versenyj&aacute;t&eacute;k, de a gy&#197;&#145;zelemhez j&oacute; taktik&aacute;ra &eacute;s n&eacute;mi szerencs&eacute;re is sz&uuml;ks&eacute;g van. &#10;N&eacute;h&aacute;ny kal&oacute;zhaj&oacute; nagy zs&aacute;km&aacute;ny rem&eacute;ny&eacute;ben nekiv&aacute;g a tengernek, hogy a t&ouml;bbiek el&#197;&#145;tt &eacute;rjen el a Kincses szigetre.

Players choose from one of four unique Goblin Guilds, each with a special set of skills and tactical advantages, and build their army to destroy anyone that stands in their way. As battles are won and lost, players gain Victory cards, Victory Points, or the ability to upgrade their army. Who will be victorious, the mighty Fighters, the cunning Thieves, the powerful Clerics, or the magical Necromancers?&#10;&#10;To begin the game, players set up the Camp, the area of the game board housing Victory Point Tokens, action markers, the Kicker card deck, the Victory card deck, and the Upgrade deck. Next, players choose a Goblin Guild consisting of 25 units. In addition to the starting units of each Guild, players have 12 draft points to use in order to draft additional units to create their own unique army. All remaining units that are not drafted are combined to create the Upgrade deck.&#10;&#10;Players will compete in battle to gain 5 valuable Victory cards. Players will secretly set up their army's battle formation behind a Battle Screen. After shuffling their unit cards,  players will draw 5 cards into their hand. These 5 cards are then set up into a battle formation consisting of 1-3 units in the first row, 1-2 units in the second, and an optional 1 unit in the third combat row. Once all players' formations are complete, players remove their Battle Screens and combat begins. Players may first recruit any available units to their army, and may then choose to activate 1 combat skill per round. Next, damage between opposing Guilds is declared and resolved. As units take damage and are defeated, they are removed from combat and are placed in a player&rsquo;s discard pile. Combat continues until one Guild is left standing, with the winner gaining the first Victory card and its benefits. Players who lose the combat round may chose to upgrade a unit in their army. Once the 5th Victory card has been won, the player with the most Victory Points is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Who will be victorious? Will it be the Mighty Fighters, the Cunning Thieves, the Powerful Clerics, or the Magical Necromancers? Choose your guild! Draft your army! Destroy your enemies!&#10;&#10;",

French publisher &quot;Au jeu retrouv&eacute;&quot; produced a version of the game in 1975 by modifying the parts illustrations.&#10;&#10;The game is played with 36 pieces each on a 9x10 square board. Each piece has a numeric value, which is hidden from the opponent and only revealed when an attacking piece moves onto a square occupied by an opponent's piece. In most cases, the piece with the highest value wins and the losing piece is removed from the board.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player finds the opponent's flag piece and takes it.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Stratego&#10;    Sharpe's Attack&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The 6th Wisconsin Regiment had been a part of the original Brigade but had been 'absorbed' due to previous losses into the other units while the 24th Michigan was added later on. They were also known as the 'Black Hat' Brigade due to their distinctive head apparel and were well respected among their foes &amp; peers. There is an excellent photo-depiction of a 're-enactment' group in full uniform on the front cover of the game box complete with their 'ostrich plumed' hats!&#10;&#10;The components consist of the following: a thin 'book-case' style cardboard box; a RULES Booklet; a 7-COLOR 17&quot; by 22&quot; paper Map sheet; 2-Sets of cardboard counters (200 total); &amp; Players must provide their OWN (2)~6-sided DICE prior to playing. This is considered to be of Moderate Complexity according to its authors. The game scale is given as: 30-yards across per HEX; Elevation intervals of 10~20-feet; each Strength Point=15-Men; and 1-Turn=6-Minutes.&#10;&#10;On the Map sheet are: the Battle Area of a portion of McPherson's Ridge about 1-Mile West of Gettysburg; the Sequence of Play; a Game Turn Track with the 2-Scenarios displayed (a separate Morning~7-Turns &amp; an Afternoon~10-Turns); &amp; a Terrain Key. There are (4)-shades of BROWN to depict varying Elevations as well as Light TAN for the lowest, BLUE for Stream, &amp; GREEN for Woods, while Fences &amp; Contour lines are in BROWN. The Game counters are printed Front &amp; Back with Light BLUE with BLACK print for the Union, &amp; Light GRAY with RED &amp; BLACK print for the Confederates (RED-Morning Scenario, BLACK-Afternoon), and WHITE with RED &amp; BLACK print for informational, replacement Officers, &amp; Strength Point markers. The counters also have various 'Hat' &amp; 'Cap' silhouettes on them to represent the Unit types while some of the informational ones have a soldier(s) silhouette(s) on them for dispositions such as 'Charge', 'Melee', 'Volley Fire', etc.&#10;&#10;The RULES detail the Historical background by Dr. David G.

The goal is to be the first to reach the Finish Line with at least 1 Bag of Gold.&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;On your turn, roll the die, then move your pawn that number of spaces. After the first turn, you can choose to move either forward or backward, but you can never land on an occupied space. If you can't move the full number on the die in either direction without ending on an occupied space, you forfeit your turn. If you land on a space marked Message Card, take a message card and follow its instructions.&#10;&#10;Along the track to the Water Tower and Finish Line, you can make detours to pick up gold doubloons. You do not have to roll exactly to reach a gold doubloon space, you can end your movement on the gold space and attempt to acquire it by rolling the number next to it. If you are successful, pick up the gold. If not, you'll have to return to the main track on your next turn, then try again if you want.&#10;&#10;When you reach the ladder to the Water Tower, you move up the ladder toward the top space marked Take Gold. You must reach the Take Gold space by exact roll. Once there you can take one Bag of Gold, plus one additional Bag for each doubloon you've collected.&#10;&#10;Then it's back down the ladder and a race to the Finish. Once you enter the area between the Water Tower and the Finish, you can not move back out of it. Watch out for the Black Spaces. If you land on a Black Space without a Bag of Gold on it, you'll have to place one of your bags of gold on it. If, however, there is already a Bag of Gold there, you can claim that Bag of Gold.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach the Finish, by exact count, with a Bag of Gold, wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

      description: "Count Your Blessings is a board game that takes players through life, encouraging them to accomplish certain things for spiritual gain while managing their finances.&#10;&#10;Players take turns to roll a die and move their tokens, executing instructions on the space their tokens land on.  Most of the time, they have to pay money, which is usually gained from the &quot;Pay Day&quot; space.  Players can also buy businesses and earn income from other players who land on those spaces.  Loans can be taken if money is insufficient, but too many loans lead to bankruptcy, which will hurt a player's final score.&#10;&#10;Blessings, used for scoring, are mostly gained by achieving accomplishments.  Most accomplishments (getting a diploma, attending church, etc) are gained by landing on the spaces required.  Some require players to have visited another space (e.g. to get married, one must land on &quot;BYU Square&quot;, pay $15,000, then proceed to the &quot;Temple Square&quot;).&#10;&#10;When landing on a Spice of Life space, players draw a card and follow the instructions printed, which can be beneficial or detrimental.  Some cards offer choices: a player can either gain cash or Blessings, or possibly mull over which to sacrifice.&#10;&#10;Blessings are scored for a player when he or she lands on the &quot;Interview Square&quot;.  The game ends when a player has three Interviews; the player with the highest total score (from three Interviews) is the winner.&#10;&#10;The 1985 version by Ungame is simpler in design.  It has fewer spaces on the board and does not have events that require players to track to different spaces to gain Blessings.  The first player to obtain a Gospel card (obtained by landing on a square) and have at least 50 Blessings (the number can be adjusted on agreement) wins and ends the game.&#10;&#10;",

At this point, the offensive player begins by turning every third card to determine the outcome of each play. Strategy:  The offensive player must decide on when to punt, kick a field goal, go for a first down or call a time out when needed. Everyone wins with this game, because the end result is ALL-IN-THE-CARDS.&#10;&#10;",

These are games that both teenage and older players can enjoy.  Having military experience is no advantage-- the methods of play are definite, decisive and easily mastered.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game board, while rudimentary, includes rivers, mountains, high ridges, railroads, roads, streams, towns and cities.  Each side has a number of counters representing infantry, artillery, cavalry, locomotives and headquarters, each with varying strength and movement capabilities.  The pieces are identified by number only (i.e., an infantry piece has a #4 on its face, and an artillery piece has a #2).  Movement is affected by terrain, as is battle strength.  The Union army wins the main game by retaining control of Chattanooga and capturing Atlanta.  The Confederates win by holding Atlanta.&#10;&#10;The game is interesting in part because of its publication date.  There wasn't much competition for Avalon Hill in the early 60s, but fans of Avalon Hill's early games will immediately recognize elements of this one.&#10;&#10;",

A few minutes ago, John Morgan was found dead at the foot of the attic steps, his neck broken at an unfortunate angle. Nobody can leave the chalet; and there is no phone or radio in here...

      description: "From the Publisher's web site:&#10;&#10;Homicide, horse-trading and horrid goings-on: a murder mystery in which it's not just the horses that get taken for a ride!&#10;&#10;For 14 to 40 guests.&#10;&#10;Set in timeless rural England, Cudham Riding Club offers all those taking part the chance to belong to the stirrup set for a few hours. Everyone is given a character, and whether you end up playing a Lord, a Lady, a dustman or a horse meat wholesaler, you will encounter more skulduggery, adultery, coercion and crime than in the entire works of Jilly Cooper, Joanna Trollope and Dick Francis. &#10; Lady Amanda Cudham, founder and chairwoman of the club, has died in tragic and mysterious circumstances. Our plot unfolds during a meeting of the club, where members decide who should replace Amanda as chairwoman.&#10;&#10;Invitations are sent out in advance, so everyone knows which character they are playing and understands some of the background. The plot is usually run over a meal and, as well as solving the murder, characters are given other objectives to achieve. Some, for instance, want to become the next chairwoman. Some have guilty secrets to keep hidden. Some have scores to settle. And everyone is keen to get rich, buy and sell a few horses, and place a few bets before the Race of the Season (the Isle of Man Handicap) gets underway.&#10;&#10;No knowledge of horses is needed to run or enjoy this plot. How much guests become involved is up to each individual but, in our own experience, even the quiet ones become utterly caught up in the action.&#10;&#10;Towards the end, a live commentary of the Isle of Man Handicap is read out and winning bets are paid out. The guest playing Inspector Dawdley then gets everyone into teams and invites each of them to put forward their solution. Finally, Dawdley reads out the correct solution, arrests the murderer and brings a fun-filled, highly entertaining and irresistibly silly occasion to a close.&#10;&#10;Word of warning:&#10;&#10;The behavior of some of the characters in &quot;Cudham Riding Club&quot; is appalling: they take drugs, they gamble, they cheat on their partners, they kill. As a result, we consider the plot to be suitable only for people aged 15 and over.&#10;&#10;",

The game board is divided into squares, but you're not told how many squares wide or long it is.&#10;3. You can only step on a square if it has a tile on it. You can step on any tile, even if it was made by another player.&#10;4. If you step on an empty square, or the tile you're standing on breaks, then you &quot;fall in&quot; and have to swim back to the nearest tile.&#10;5. Each empty square that either borders a tile or the starting edge of the game board has a question visible on it. The questions are very simple and have single answers, such as &quot;why does water flow downhill?&quot; or &quot;why can light pass through glass?&quot; or &quot;what is heat?&quot;&#10;6. The only way to make new tiles is by making-up an answer to the question.&#10;7. A tile will only float if you can verify the answer with a reproducible test.&#10;8. A tile can only be broken by proving the answer is wrong with a reproducible test.&#10;9. A test can't break a tile if its results can't be reproduced, a tile can't float if the verifying test's results can't be reproduced.&#10;10. If a tile is broken, then all tiles ahead of it that cannot be connected back to the starting edge by another continuous series of tiles will be broken as well.&#10;11. A player is defined as someone who obeys the rules. If you stop obeying the rules you cease to be a player until you start obeying the rules again.&#10;&#10;Further explanation of the rules can be found at: &#10;http://www.disenchanted.com/technology/game.html&#10;&#10;",

For one night we will return to the good old days when Elvis was at the top of the charts. Sock hops, hula-hoops and poodles were radioactive. Getting pinned meant something altogether different than it does these days.&#10;&#10;The Class of '57 was written to be a little different than the rest of our games. First of all the 10 or 12 main suspects are all couples very much in love. Couples will be working together at times to achieve goals. They may have some secrets from each other, but overall they will be working to protect each other. This gives the game a romantic flavor. This murder mystery game is what we would call a 'clean' game. There are no affairs &amp; people are basically good. This game is great for church groups and others who are worried about the possibility of offending guests. It can also be used for older teen groups!&#10;&#10;Another difference is that the murder happens before the game. Being a couples murder mystery we felt it would be too complicated to murder them both or only one. That is not to say that there won't be more murders during the evening. Those tend to happen in our games since we provide a lot of intrigue outside of the murder itself.&#10;&#10;The 12 player version has 6 couples and we include our 2 Extra Character Packets to expand the game up to 32. The Extra Character Packets add a little quirky flavor to the party, but not all of these 20 extra characters may be suitable for conservative groups. (Remember... these are included FREE in the 12 player version, no need to purchase them!)&#10;&#10;",

Detectives on the scene immediately noticed that Robo Gal's electro-cerebrum had been tampered with.... as well as her power pack units.

Each player has one leader playing piece, several citizens, and some henchman - he must try to get his leader and citizens to the opposite side of the board, trying to lose as few as possible. The other player tries the same with his men. Also both players have &quot;servants&quot; or henchmen, who are expendable for &quot;the dirty work&quot;.&#10;In the end each player gets points for his citizens and leader for reaching the other side - the number of remaining henchman does not matter.&#10;&#10;The movement is determined by throwing a dice - but only one player throws it, both have then to use the same number of movement points.&#10;&#10;In the four player variant two players control the citizens and the leader, the other two try to help their allies with the henchmen - but they are not allowed to communicate with their partners.&#10;&#10;",

It is similar in play and design as Senet.&#10;&#10;The object is to be the first player to bear off all 5 of his pieces, by landing them precisely on the last square.&#10;Once successfully borne off, a piece plays no further part in the game.&#10;&#10;PLAYER TURNS&#10;The players throw once each alternately, and move a single piece by the appropriate number of positions. A&#10;move must be made, and made in full. If no move is possible, then the turn is forfeit (passes to the other&#10;player). When forfeiting a throw, the opponent has the option of adding the forfeited throw to his own.&#10;&#10;HOW TO MOVE THE PIECES&#10;Each player enters the pieces onto the board from his reserve and moves them as follows:&#10;Pieces move forward only. As pieces reach the last square (by exact throw), they bear off; be the first to&#10;bear off all your pieces and you win! The marked squares give you an extra turn; when you land on them, you&#10;get to throw the sticks and go again. Only one piece may occupy any given square; if you land on an opposing&#10;piece, it is removed &mdash;sent back to the player&rsquo;s reserve.&#10;To bring your first piece on, you must first throw a 4 or a 6; when that happens, you throw again and move&#10;the piece in by that amount. The remaining pieces can be brought in on any throw. Waiting for that initial&#10;throw of 4 or 6, particularly while the opponent is already moving, can be quite frustrating, so it is an acceptable&#10;variant to forego that rule entirely.&#10;&#10;",

Corners with anchors of a player's own color are his home corners, and corners with anchors of his opponent's color are away corners. A group is an anchor if it touches three or more sides of the board. If a group touches just two sides, it is an anchor only if these two sides do not meet at an away corner. When both players pass consecutively, any group that is not an anchor is ruled dead and is removed from the board. Each player then figures his score, which is the sum of his territory (vacant surrounded points) plus dead stones of his opponent.&#10;&#10;",

If a player answers a question almost right, but not quite, they can ask for a vote on whether the answer will be accepted (a draw counts as a fail). They are also used in the &quot;Opinion of...&quot;-squares, for example &quot;In the opinion of men, female bodybuilders are sexy?&quot; If the majority of other players agree with how the player thinks men and women generally think, they win that card.&#10;&#10;As an elimination/game lengthening feature, there are also 'Black hole'-squares on the board; category gets chosen by opponents and if the player is wrong, they lose ALL categories so far collected, ie. start from the beginning again.&#10;&#10;Once all four categories are collected, player may proceed to the center of the board, where they need to answer one question from each category during the same turn, and get at least one right, in which case they win.&#10;&#10;Questions and answers are sometimes slightly naughty/risque especially in the &quot;Opinion of...&quot;-categories, hence the high age limit.&#10;&#10;",

The most likely reason is that they licensed Don's endorsement for the 1964 edition of the game but neglected to update the rules sheet to accommodate the newer name.

Certain defined sections of the board can only have one of each number in them. When each of certain small sections of the board is filled, the tiles for each player in the section are totaled and points given for first and second place. Bonus points are also given for players who complete larger board sections. The sections which define the placement constraints, regular scoring, and bonus scoring vary from game to game.&#10;&#10;The six games are:&#10;&#10;1. Classic-SuDoku, played on the standard 9x9 grid.&#10;&#10;2. Labyrinth-SuDoku, played on a board divided into nine irregular nine-square sections.&#10;&#10;3. Killer-SuDoku, played on a board divided into many small sections.&#10;&#10;4. Kakuro, played on a 9x9 grid interrupted by numbered squares.

The IAGO Chess system accomplishes its objectives by the use of multiple versions (classes) of the game that represent the fullness of the chess experience. These versions build upon one another,&#10;to allow a person to get fully familiar with the game. There are six versions (classes) of the game.

There is a distinct advantage to fantasy role gaming from a board; and that is it gets rid of the need for a Game Master or scenario creator. The board, cards and matrix tables contain all the information necessary and the dice determine the outcome of your adventure. No human arbitrator is necessary.&#10;&#10;All the passages, rooms, treasure and monsters are randomly generated. This makes no two adventures ever the same. Each time you enter the Witchlord's Castle you can expect a completely different scenario stocked with new treasure and monsters. As the player moves around the board, he will receive information about the configurations of the Witchlord's Castle. This will enable the player to plot his progress on the graph paper given.&#10;&#10;The player will choose one of the six Adventure Classes to play. this determines the player's spell and weapon capability.&#10;&#10;The player's objective in the game is to collect proficiency points. This is done by the slaying of monsters and the collection of treasure. Encounters and treasure are dictated by the playing cards and matrix tables. When the player reaches the 10th stratum or proficiency level, he must do battle with one of the Witchlord's generals. If the General is vanquished, the the player has won and earned safe passage out of Witchlord's Castle.&#10;&#10;The Witchlord Game can be played as a single scenario, or as a campaign game.&#10;&#10;",

Unfortunately, being somewhat shy of means (i.e., broke), you are unable to afford the more reputable establishments. Acting on Kaka&rsquo;s dubious suggestion, you&#10;head out to the edge of town to a place your mother told you never to go: the old, abandoned tower built by that nutcase, K&rsquo;Dak. K&rsquo;Dak was a washout from pyramid building school. He just could never get the pyramid concept straight. Big on the bottom and small on top. How is this hard? Anyway, his attempt at building a small summer&#10;pyramid for the pharaoh ended up as a six-story, straight up and down tower. The pharaoh was not amused and K&rsquo;Dak was banished from the community in disgrace. That should have been the end of it, but K&rsquo;Dak had in mind one last futile gesture before he left. He returned to the tower, hid small amounts of gold throughout the structure and then set up a booby trap for anyone who tried to retrieve the gold. However, before he could spread a story of a fabulous treasure residing in his tower, he was run out of town by the authorities and never seen again. The pharaoh intended to condemn the place for demolition, but got distracted with a border war and K&rsquo;Dak&rsquo;s tower was largely&#10;forgotten. And now, you and Kaka are heading to this questionable monument on the outside chance that there is something inside that you can barter for a camel makeover.&#10;&#10;K&rsquo;Dak&rsquo;s Tower of Confusion and Camel Wash is a game of exploration. You and your opponent climb through an abandoned tower hoping to collect enough treasure in order to pay for a bath for Phredd. Things go just fine until one of you reaches the top layer, at which time the tower starts shaking itself apart. You then have to get out before the whole structure collapses on you while still finding enough treasure to make the expedition worthwhile.&#10;&#10;",

      description: "(Text by the publisher) Bildsch&ouml;ne Wortspiele is a compact collection of 8 card games that deal with images and associated words. The set contains 100 cards (90 photos, 6 jokers, 4 blancs), 4 cards with suggestions for words, 1 booklet with rules and examples.&#10;The principal mechanism is very simple: You form compounds by combining the words that you associate with two or more photos. A photo doesn&rsquo;t represent only one word. For instance, for the photo that shows an eagle you can also say &quot;bird&quot;, or &quot;beak&quot;, or &quot;head&quot;, or &quot;feather&quot;, or &quot;claw&quot;, or &quot;animal&quot; and so on. Thus, in combination with other cards in the set, you can form numerous words such as &quot;bird bath&quot;, &quot;bird table&quot;, &quot;frigate bird&quot;, &quot;game bird&quot;, &quot;pack animal&quot;, &quot;stuffed animal&quot;, &quot;animal farm&quot;, &quot;animal world&quot; and so on.&#10;The games can be played on all language levels. The selection of the photos ensures that you can form a large number of compounds within the range of basic vocabulary. Also, you can extend the linguistic range deliberately in terms of code, style and special languages.&#10;In educational contexts the games cannot only be used for vocabulary training. It is also possible to train more subtle competences such as abstract thinking (eagle &gt; bird &gt; animal), the perception of paralleles and differences (bird: bird of prey vs. singing bird), style and narrating (you put down one card after another and let narrate / narrate yourself).&#10;You can play most of the games either in competition or in coordination. Some of the games you can even play on your own. Depending on which game is played, the emphasis is on speed, concentration, memory, or wit. All the games are a challenge to imagination.&#10;The games are suited for cross-generational, highly communicative playing within the family. They have also been designed for educational and therapeutical purposes. (End of text by the publisher)&#10;&#10;",

The goal of the game is to become the City's most prominent performer by having the highest number of Prestige Points at the end of the game. Prestige Points are earned by creating/assembling astounding illusions and &ldquo;performing&rdquo; them at various types of theatres in the city. Strategy, timing and elements of luck all play a role in your rise to prominence, as do the political machinations and jealousy of your peers.&quot;&#10;&#10;It's basically a set-collection card game that plays in 30-45 minutes. The suits are four different types of illusions commonly performed by late-Victorian era stage magicians and you'll need an &quot;aha!&quot; idea card of a suit and a card of values 1,2 and 3 of the same suit to perform (put into play) an illusion to earn Prestige Points points. There are 16 different magicians to play, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, optional trait cards, and the all important Events (fate) deck that you both need and dread.&#10;&#10;",

At the conclusion of the games, the cost and value of each home is calculated, producing a winner(s).&#10;&#10;Each mini-game has a contributory goal to the overall goal.&#10;&#10;In Mortgage Mambo, the mini-game goal is to get as many loan offers as possible and then to select from those offers.&#10;&#10;In Realtor Roundup, the mini-game goal is to get to the best realtor and therefore get the largest number of buyer incentives.&#10;&#10;In Inspection Perfection, the mini-game goal is to increase the cost or decrease the value of your opponents Home Buyer's Contract.&#10;&#10;The Rules&#10;&#10;House Hunt General Rules&#10;&#10;For both single player games and games of two or more.&#10;&#10;1. Each player should take a blank Home Buyer's contract. Each player will need a pen or pencil to record results on their home buyer's contract.&#10;   2. Select one Home Profile from the set of Home Profile cards. Each player will use the same home profile as a starting part for their home contract.&#10;   3. Each player then uses a pencil to fill out their home-buyer's contract with the information from the home profile card.&#10;   4. For a complete game, play in the following order:&#10;          * Mortgage Mambo&#10;          * Realtor Roundup&#10;          * Inspection Perfection&#10;   5. You may also play each game by itself or skip one or two of the games. If Inspection Perfection is played, it should always be played last.&#10;&#10;Realtor Roundup and Mortgage Mambo Rules&#10;&#10;For two or more players:&#10;&#10;1. Select one side of the draw box for the game you are playing to pull cards from.&#10;   2. Place the END GAME marker in the middle of the draw box For a longer game, place it closer to the side opposite where you will draw from.&#10;   3. All player tokens begin at START.&#10;   4. Select one player to be first. This is the current player.&#10;   5. The player on the right of the current player draws a task card from the draw box and asks the current player the question on the outside of the card.&#10;   6. If the current player requests a hint, the player on the right opens the card and reads the hint (usually a set of multiple choice answers).&#10;   7. The number of spaces a player may move is stated on each task card and depends on whether the current player got the answer right and whether a hint was used. Follow the directions on the task cards.&#10;   8. When a player lands on a space with directions, the player should follow those directions prior to the next player taking a turn.&#10;   9. When a current player's turn is over, play proceeds clockwise to the next player, who becomes the current player.&#10;&#10;For single players:&#10;&#10;1. Set up play as for two or more players.&#10;   2. Draw task cards and answer the questions.&#10;   3. If you need a hint, open the task card enough to see the hint while still obscuring the answer.&#10;   4. When you've answered the question, open the card completely to confirm if your answer is correct.&#10;   5. Move your token as directed and record any changes to your home buyer's contract.&#10;&#10;Inspection Perfection Rules&#10;&#10;For two or more players only.&#10;&#10;1. Shuffle Inspection Deck. Each player should take four (4) cards from the deck, making certain not to show the cards to other players.&#10;   2. There are two objectives to this game. The first is to discard all of your cards. The second is to ask other players questions that you think they don't know, forcing them to pick up another card from the pile and to receive a penalty which will affect their home buyer's contract.&#10;   3. Play proceeds as follows:&#10;          * A player chooses a card from his/her hand and asks any other player the question on the card.&#10;          * If the questioned player gets the answer correct, s/he receives the reward specified on the card.&#10;          * If the questioned player gets the answer wrong, s/he receives the penalty specified on the card and must draw a card from the inspection pile.&#10;          * In either case, the questioning player discards the card in the common discard pile.&#10;   4. Play then proceeds to the player on the left of the player who just asked the question.&#10;   5. When one player has no more cards, the game is over.&#10;&#10;Ending The Games&#10;&#10;At the end of the games, complete the calculations on your home buyer's contract. The person with the best deal wins.&#10;&#10;",

Place the mystery element envelope on the mystery element box on the board.&#10;   3. Put the question cards on the question box on the board.&#10;   4. Pick a game piece and place it in the nucleus.&#10;   5. Distribute markers and periodic table folders to each team.&#10;&#10;Playing Game - read all directions before playing&#10;&#10;1. BEGINNING PLAY - Each team rolls a die. The highest number goes first.&#10;   2. One at a time, all teams must answer a question card correctly to cross from the nucleus to the first shell.&#10;   3. If answered incorrectly, wait until your next turn to try again. You must answer the question correctly to leave the nucleus and start playing.&#10;   4. After your team has correctly answered a question card, move your piece from the nucleus along one of the bridges and remain there until your next turn.&#10;   5. CONTINUING PLAY - On your next turn, roll the die and travel in any direction along that shell.&#10;   6. ELECTRON CARDS - When you land on an electron clue card, pick up the card and share it only with your team.  Use your periodic table to mark off elements that the clue eliminates.  Once an electron clue card is picked up, the space becomes null.&#10;   7. QUESTION BRIDGES - Use the question card bridges to travel to available clue cards in different shells. You must answer the question correctly to use the question card bridge.&#10;   8. ELEMENT SYMBOL/DIAGRAM SPACES - If you land on an element symbol, jump to the corresponding element diagram, and vice versa.&#10;   9. WINNING THE GAME - Once your team thinks they have determined the mystery element, travel back to the nucleus, answering question cards correctly to travel across the bridges and rolling the die. It is not necessary to land in the nucleus by an exact roll of the die.  Once in the nucleus, you may announce your guess and check the envelope. If you are right, you win! If you are wrong, place the card back in the envelope, your team is out and the game continues with the other teams.&#10;&#10;",

Each player must reach the finish, or &ldquo;Lights Out,&rdquo; and the player with the fewest calories at &ldquo;Lights Out&rdquo; is the winner.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;Caloric Consequences&#10;&#10;OBJECT: The object of Caloric Consequences is to get through a day of meals and activities (from Wake Up and Smell the Coffee to Lights Out) with the fewest total calories.&#10;&#10;SETUP: Place the cards in the appropriate places on the board and distribute one notepad, one pencil, and one game-piece to each player. The game is for 2&ndash;4 players, ages 21 and up.&#10;&#10;RULES:&#10;&#10;1.           All players roll the die. The player with the highest roll goes first, then the turn passes to the right.&#10;&#10;2.           All players start on Wake Up &amp; Smell the Coffee.&#10;&#10;3.           The active player rolls the die once during a turn and moves his or her piece according to the number indicated.&#10;&#10;4.           The player to the left of the active player draws a card from the stack that corresponds to the space the active player lands on and reads the scenario and the options, NOT the calories.&#10;&#10;5.           The active player MUST choose one of the options. (It can be assumed that all of the food and drink options on a card are of the same serving size.)&#10;&#10;6.           The inactive player reveals the caloric value of the active player&rsquo;s choice, and the active player records that value on his or her notepad. (Each player should total his or her calories after each turn. Players may use calculators.) The inactive player then reads the remaining caloric values.&#10;&#10;7.           If a player lands on Free Time and chooses an activity to do right now, he or she MUST physically complete that activity.&#10;&#10;8.           Play repeats according to the steps above.&#10;&#10;9.           The first player to reach Lights Out deducts 100 calories.&#10;&#10;10.       The game ends when all players reach Lights Out. An exact roll of the die is NOT necessary to reach Lights Out.&#10;&#10;11.       To Win: The player with the lowest number of calories wins.&#10;&#10;12.       In the case of a tie, the winner can be determined with one of the following methods: flip a coin, roll the die, pushup contest, arm-wrestling, rock-paper-scissors, thumb-war, draw straws, or staring contest.&#10;&#10;OPTIONAL: Players may calculate the excess calories they consumed in a day and estimate how much weight they would gain in a year if they made the same choices in life that they made in the game with the equations below:&#10;&#10;total calories &ndash; 2,000 = excess daily calories&#10;&#10;excess daily calories x 365 &cedil; 3,500 = yearly weight gain&#10;&#10;LONG GAME: Play can be lengthened by circling the board more than once.&#10;&#10;CARD GAME: To play as a card game, players take turns reading cards to each other, reading one card per turn, going in order from Breakfast to Dinner. Players choose options and calculate calories as in regular play.&#10;&#10;",

      description: "Gods of Olympus is a Board Game for players aged 12 to adult. The game can be played in 2-6 individual players or teams and it includes a variety of challenges. There are 7 categories of challenges- 5 power challenges -Knowledge, Performance, Visual, Physical, Logical- plus General challenges and Battle challenges. Each category has at least 10 different types of tasks of different difficulty levels and styles.&#10;&#10;The game is staged in Ancient Greece when Gods were ruling over the earth and influenced the lives of men.  The players enter the Labyrinth and go towards the center to beat the Minotaur and become Heroes.  On their way, players gather Powers, by completing challenges.  Once they are heroes, they need to go back and get out of the Labyrinth. Only a true God can escape the mythical Maze alive. On their way back they need stronger powers that they gather by completing Hero challenges. The first to escape the Labyrinth is the winner &ndash; a God of Olympus.&#10;&#10;The story: The Gods of Olympus decided to welcome one human among them as one of their peers. But it cannot be any human. He/she has to be worthy of becoming a God, the best they can find, one who is a true hero and of special character. Each city of Ancient Greece selected their best representative and sent them to participate to the Gods of Olympus Challenge.  Each city selected the bravest, the strongest, the smartest and the most talented citizen to represent them in the Gods Challenge and gain protection of the Gods for their city and the people living in it.&#10;&#10;You are the representative of one of the cities of Ancient Greece. As your city representative you will have to enter the Labyrinth, face multiple challenges that require skill, strength, knowledge, reach the Centre of the Labyrinth and face the Minotaur. To reach the centre of the labyrinth you need the 5 magic powers you gain on your way, but you also need luck and a good strategy.  You have to act smart, solve the challenges and move fast inside the labyrinth and out.  On your way, you'll have to avoid dangerous creatures like the Gorgons that can turn you into stone. You may also have to fight your opponents in fair battle, especially if they attack you. Only the first getting out of the labyrinth can become a God of Olympus and anyone can still win the game no matter how advanced the other players are, provided they play smart.&#10;&#10;",

It offered a wooden stock, shaped to nestle in the shoulder, which now meant a gun could be aimed. Politically, France&rsquo;s defeat at Pavia changed the balance of power in Europe.

It will be hard to keep your mind out of the gutter while playing or asking for any one of the 16 different hilarious images on the Go Hunt cards.&#10;&#10;Goal: To collect the most matching sets, either sets of 2 or 4. You decide on game play.  Matching sets 2 will make for a quicker game, sets of  4 will extend game play.&#10;&#10;There are 16 differant card images to play and match: Bald Beaver, Big Cock, Big Honkers, Cuddly Puss, Cute Ass, Dry Puss, Excited Monkey, Fat Beaver, Little Hooters, Fat Weiner, Little Monkey, Nice Rack, Red Pecker, Stretched Puss, Small Cock, Wet Puss.  The images are all innocent pictures of animals, check them out in our picture gallery! No animals were hurt in the making of the Go Hunt card game.&#10;&#10;Game play: With four or less players; seven cards are dealt to each player.  Five cards can be dealt to each player in larger groups.  The remaining cards are placed face down in a draw pile.  The player left of the dealer goes first.  On your turn, ask any player for a specific card.  For example: &quot;Michele do you have little hooters?&quot;  You must already hold one of the requested cards.  If Michele has any little hooter cards she must give them all to you.  If the person you ask does not have the card you requested, they would say &quot;Go Hunt!&quot;  You would then draw a card from the draw pile.  When the draw pile runs out, keep playing until all the cards have been made into matching sets.  When you collect a set of matching cards, immediately show the other players and place the cards face down in front of you.&#10;&#10;Is is fair to lump all pair matching games together? Yes it has the same type of play as go fish, but the card images really make the game stand out. Playing basketball, and playing a game of HORSE is differant, for example in the game Go Hunt there is a card with an image of a fat beaver eating an apple, the card is called &quot;FAT BEAVER&quot;, now imagine this card and 15 others in play, would you ask your grandma if she had a &quot;FAT BEAVER&quot;, &quot;WET PUSS&quot; or even a &quot;LARGE COCK&quot;.&#10;&#10;In conclusion if you have an inoccent soul and a naughty mind you&quot;ll have a blast playing the Go Hunt card game with your friends!&#10;&#10;There are also variants of the Go Hunt game that are drinking games, so if your over 21 give them a try!&#10;&#10;",

Parker called Chivalry &quot;the best game in 2,000 years,&quot; and looked upon it as his personal favorite.  Chivalry is played on a larger board with more pieces than Camelot.  Chivalry, like Camelot, is tactically complex, yet easily learned and quickly played.  It is a clever mixture of American Checkers (British Draughts) and Halma (Chinese Checkers).&#10;&#10;The goals of the game is to move two pieces into the two goal spaces on the opposite side of the board. Of course, one has to get past the opponent's piece to do so. Movement of pieces in many ways resembles Checkers except that jumping and moving is omnidirectional.&#10;&#10;This game tends to be dominated by key sacrifices and charges for the goal. Since a player has to get two pieces into the goal, the dynamic shifts from just trying to get a single piece into a goal. In other words, players won't make one sudden leap to victory; at least a 1-2 punch is required.&#10;&#10;For those familiar with Camelot:&#10;&#10;Chivalry is different than Camelot in the following ways:&#10;&#10;     The Chivalry board has 176 squares.  The Camelot board has 160 squares.  &#10;     Each side in Chivalry has eight Knights and twelve Men.  Each side in Camelot has four Knights and ten Men.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

In spite of the name, this game is a three-handed version of Cam, not Camelot in that the first first to enter a goal wins and so ends the game. Often this means that a player can block one but not both opponents. Hence these games can end suddenly and kingmaking can be involved.&#10;&#10;",

The game is played in rounds; in each round, two tokens have to be connected.

In later rounds, the destination token from the previous round becomes the starting token.&#10;&#10;Now, the players take turns placing dominoes in the line from the start token to the destination token, building past any other tokens. Each turn, a player rolls a die, which allows him to add zero to three dominoes to the line. When the destination token is reached, the round ends. The player whose turn it is gets to topple the dominoes by pushing the first domino in the line. First, though, the other players have to predict whether or not the entire line of dominoes will fall.&#10;&#10;After predictions have been made, the first domino is toppled. If the entire line falls, then the toppling player receives a gift token, as well as any player who made the right prediction; if some dominoes remain standing, the players who predicted that receive a gift token.&#10;&#10;After six rounds, the game ends, and the player who has gained the most gift tokens wins.&#10;&#10;In the expert version of the game, various contraptions for connecting two lines of dominoes are included, and in each round, one of these is included in the line of dominoes connecting the start and destination.&#10;&#10;",

Plans were to expand a breakthrough and with cavalry and infantry reserves take the Aubers ridge line. However, poor communication and coordination and the weather conspired to slow the initial British successes and allowed the German army to rush reinforcements into the area. Among other game features, designer Michael W. Kennedy uses offensive artillery and defensive artillery fire, British command checks, and a unique assault combat mechanic to simulate the bloody struggle. (Sourced from the White Dog Games website.)&#10;&#10;The game is played over a series of 14 turns which represent the three days of The Battle of Neuve Chapelle. Each day is divided into four turns with a separate night turn in between. During the day turns, both sides will fire artillery (weather permitting), move, and attack. During the night turns, both sides will dig in new trenches on the new front lines.&#10;&#10;The game simulates early trench warfare and makes prominent use of artillery and the defensive advantages of trenches. Weather conditions and British communications among the four divisions are determined randomly each turn. Each assault phase contains a defensive artillery and defensive combat phase, making defense a major component of the game.&#10;&#10;There are several hexes that have victory point values. The British win by controlling as many of these hexes as possible. The Germans win by preventing the British from achieving this objectives.&#10;&#10;",

      description: "From the rules: &quot;The object of the game is not only to afford amusement to the players but also to illustrate to them how proposed Share-the-Wealth Plans, Excessive Old Age Pension Plans, etc., will increase taxes and place a heavy burden on all citizens and, at the same time, make it possible for the shrewd manipulators to gain a dominating position in economical affairs of the country.&#10;&#10;At the outset, let it be understood that before the Government can bring about a share-the-wealth program it must own all properties and all monies. Under a share-the-wealth scheme it is proposed that the Government shall make every man a king and give each person an equal share of the money, after which time each must take care of himself. If a man has good luck and is a shrewd manager, he may beat the game of &quot;inflation.&quot; If he isn't, he will be no better off than theretofore and distribution of the wealth of the country will not have availed him anything&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;This game is played like modern Monopoly. From Wikipedia: &quot;Inflation board game came to the attention of Parker Brothers management in the 1930s, after they began sales of Monopoly. Copeland continued sales of the latter game after Parker Brothers attempted a patent lawsuit against him. Parker Brothers held the Magie and Darrow patents, but settled with Copeland rather than going to trial, since Copeland was prepared to have witnesses testify that they had played Monopoly before Darrow's &quot;invention&quot; of the game. The court settlement allowed Copeland to license Parker Brothers' patents&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

The theme is almost the same but instead of buying properties, players buy shares of companies.&#10;&#10;On his turn, a player rolls one die and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned company share, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio (there is no option to auction it). The more shares of one company a player owns, the more profit he will gain when any other player lands on the company. There are no houses or hotels in this game.&#10;&#10;There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes or collect income.&#10;&#10;The main difference between Makler Gie&#197;&#130;dowy and Monopoly is the marketplace. Every time the player passes by the marketplace, he can go to it. Depending on the number thrown on the die the player may buy 1, 2, 3 or 4 shares. Selling is unlimited. Just before acquiring the player draws a market card which shows the price change. The share may be more or less expensive. It is possible to buy every unowned share in the game. It is not possible to buy shares from another players or sell them. There is no negotiation in this game and the trading is allowed only through the marketplace.&#10;&#10;The game ends when first player goes bankrupt. The most wealthy player is declared the winner.

Up to five players work together as heroes on missions against the enemies of the Imperium (Solo play is also supported).&#10;&#10;Each new game begins with players choosing from one of six hero archetypes: Assassin, Duelist, Grunt, Medic, Officer, and Psi Mage. Each hero is represented by a Stat card listing his attributes and default abilities/attacks. Each hero also has a deck of Ability cards from which the player can choose up to five. Some Ability cards are marked as &quot;Advanced&quot; and count as two cards. This allows players to choose fewer, but more powerful cards if they wish.&#10;&#10;Once player have chosen their heroes and Ability cards, they select a mission to be played. Each mission description includes which enemies will be encountered and what goals the player must meet to win. An Encounter deck can also be used (especially for solo players) to randomize which enemies will be fought during the mission.&#10;&#10;Each mission also includes a map of the game board. The board consists of several tiles that players assemble prior to the beginning of play. Paper miniatures, representing both heroes and enemies, are placed on the board and moved on a turn-by-turn basis. Each turn allows players to carry out several actions including attacking, movement, and using items. Control of the enemy side is either done by a single player who chose not to have a hero, or by hero players on a rotating basis.&#10;&#10;Enemies in the game are grouped into three main factions: the primitive Ferans, slave-trading Ougluks, and the technologically advanced Warlock Industries. Each enemy, like the heroes, has a Stat card listing its attributes and default abilities/attacks. They do not, however, get additional Ability cards.&#10;&#10;",

      description: "FROM THE BOX:&#10;&#10;Haven't you always wondered who your perfect match is? The New Perfect Match Game is the fun way to find out. The game is played by couples who are asked a series of questions with four alternative answers supplied. These questions cover topics ranging from sex to politics and the arts. Each partner decides on their favourite response and uses the electronic Perfect Match device to check their compatibility and advance along the board. the first couple to reach the Perfect Match Heart Light are the winners. Who will be your Perfect Match?&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;2 Electronic Perfect Match Devices.&#10;288 Question Cards.&#10;1 Die.&#10;4 Position Markers.&#10;Perfect Match Game Board.&#10;&#10;The players are divided into couples. Each couple takes a position marker and places it in the start square. Remove the perfect match cards from their perforations and place them in their marked positions on the game board.&#10;&#10;The Perfect Match Cards:&#10;These cards are divided into two categories: pink 'Girls' cards and blue 'Guys' cards. As the game proceeds, question cards are taken from the 'Girls' pile if the playing couple lands on a pink square or From the 'Guys' pile if they land on a blue square. Each card contains one questions with four alternative&#10;answers marked A,B,C or D.&#10;&#10;Choosing the right answer:&#10;If the couple lands on a blue square, one of the other players picks up a 'Guys' card and directs one question on it to the male partner. He must choose the alternative which he feels is most appropriate to him. His partner must try to anticipate his feelings or attitudes on that question and choose the same alternative. Couples should be open and honest in their choice of answer. Similarly, if the couple lands on a pink square, a 'Girls' card would be taken and its question directed towards the female partner. She will choose and answer and her partner should try to anticipate this response.&#10;&#10;Questions marked 'BOTH' are  designed to test compatibility, with each partner choosing their own favourite answer in response to the question asked.&#10;&#10;Using the Electronic Perfect Match device:&#10;These devices are in the shape of four hearts joined together. Each heart is labeled A,B,C or D, representing the four alternatives on the Perfect Match question cards. When a question is asked and each partner has silently decided on which alternative to choose, they each hold up their device with the chosen representative letter uppermost. They must not allow each other to see their choices. The two devices are then pressed together. If the electronic tone sounds, a perfect match has been achieved for that question.&#10;&#10;Dare Cards:&#10;Scattered throughout both packs of cards are Dare Cards. If one these cards appears, the couple must perform whatever is required of them according to the instructions on the card. Their performance is adequate (as indicated by a show of hands) then the couple may roll the die again and continue their turn. Be warned - if you are too easy on others then there is no challenge to perform well. If you are too tough, then your opponent will be equally tough on you. So be fair!&#10;&#10;Playing the game: Each couple rolls the die once and those with the highest score start, moving their marker the corresponding number of squares. One of the other players then reads the first question to the starting couple. If the couple achieves a Perfect Match, they roll the die again and advance the corresponding number of squares along the board. Remember, a couple can only roll the die and advance after  they have successfully answered a Perfect Match question or performed a Dare task. The couple continues in this way until they are unsuccessful in either a Perfect Match question or a Dare performance, in which case the control of the game is handed over to the next couple (moving clockwise).&#10;&#10;Winning the Game:&#10;The first couple to reach the Perfect Match Heart Light and then successfully achieve a Perfect Match from their Choice of either a Girls or Guys question will be declared the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Special Note&#10;&#10;&#10;Should the electronic tone stop working use a nail file or a similar tool to lever apart the two case sections of the blue device. Carefully removed the battery, replacing it with one of identical type. Be sure to position it positive side up. When pressing the case sections back together, locate the letter &quot;A&quot; on the plastic cover over the battery position.&#10;&#10;Based on the formerly popular 1980s Network Ten (and much later Seven Network in 2002) Australian TV dating game show of the same name.&#10;&#10;",

The player then has ten seconds to study the picture on the card. When the timer runs out the card is passed to player two and player one rolls the die to see which question is to be asked. The questions are on the reverse of the picture card. Player Two checks the answer by looking at the picture and if it is correct the card is given back to Player One to keep. If the answer is wrong the card is placed back into the Brainbox and the next player chooses a card. Please remember, the answer to the question is on the picture side of the card, so look carefully! The player with the most cards after ten minutes wins! If there is a tie, it's sudden death with both players choosing a card and having to answer all eight questions on the card. The player who answers the most correctly wins! For 1 player Look at the card as above for ten seconds. Then turn the card over and answer all the questions (use a pen and paper to record the answers). If all questions are answered correctly the card is kept. If any answers are incorrect, the card has to be put back in the Brainbox. See how many cards you have after five or ten minutes.&#10;&#10;",

One player will play as Talibans, the other as a group of Polish soldiers who get ambushed by the Afghans.&#10;&#10;Before the game each player will pick several characters that will represent his forces. The goal of the game is to gain victory points by killing the opponents characters. Stronger characters will be of more use during the game but will also give the opponent more points once killed.&#10;&#10;The game lasts four rounds and each round last three phases:&#10;&#10;- Straighten + draw phase&#10;Each player straightens his characters so he can use them in the new round. Also each player draws cards until they have four cards in hand.&#10;&#10;- Action phase&#10;In the action phase players can perform actions until both of them decide to pass. For an action they can play a card from their hand (events or attachments), use an ability of a character or shoot using one of their characters. Each character can shoot once per action phase. &#10;When a character shoots players form an &quot;exchange fire&quot; pool by adding into it two &quot;miss&quot; cards and as many &quot;hit&quot; cards as is indicated on the shooting characters card. Now players can manipulate the &quot;exchange fire&quot; pool by playing cards that add either &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;miss&quot; cards. When both players don't want to play anymore cards they randomly pick one card from the pool. If it is a &quot;miss&quot; nothing happens, if it is a &quot;hit&quot;  the shot character loses one life point. If his life points are reduced to 0 he dies and victory points are awarded.&#10;&#10;- Discard phase&#10;Each player may discard one card from his hand.&#10;&#10;After the fourth round the player with the most victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;If players own more than one copy of Warcard: Afganistan they can build their own decks before the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players draw and discard their way to an empty hand, laying down a variety of cards designed around a medieval theme. Each deck comes with 72 cards and supports a game of 2-4 players. Included are 48 Medieval Unit Cards (4 Colored Factions: Blue Cross, Green Star, Red &amp; Gold, and Purple Chevron).&#10;&#10;In addition to the 48 Unit cards, there are 16 Wizards (4 different classes for each colored faction), and 6 Plague Cards. Plague Cards do not belong to any color; therefore, they cannot be discarded, ONLY PURGED. Plague Cards were created to prevent you from getting rid of all your cards. There are several ways to remove these cards from your hand (see Wizard Cards). Part of the fun is discovering these various methods of &quot;purging&quot; the Plague.&#10;&#10;Wizard Cards are played in the same manner as the other Colored Units. For example, a Blue Wizard can be played on top of any Blue Unit or on top of any other Wizard. There are four types of Wizard Cards, each with their own unique action.&#10;&#10;Swap-A-Hand Wizard - When you play this Wizard, swap your hand with the hand of another player. The choice of which player to Swap-A- Hand with is yours. Once the &ldquo;swap&rdquo; has occurred, play continues to the next player in turn.&#10;&#10;Draw Two Wizard - When you play this Wizard, the next player must draw 2 cards. The player who draws the additional cards will still be able to play their turn. If they do not have a playable card after Drawing Two, they must continue to Draw until they draw a card that can be played. A turn is determined complete when a card has been played.&#10;&#10;Purge-A-Card Wizard - When you play this Wizard, you may discard ANY card of your choice from your hand. Place the card of your choice facedown on the tabletop, thus removing it from the game completely. The card has now been PURGED.&#10;&#10;Purge-The-Plague Wizard - When you play this Wizard, you may discard ONLY Plague Cards from your hand. However there is no limit to how many Plague Cards you can discard. Place the Plague Card(s) face up on the tabletop, thus removing it from the game completely. *The two &quot;Purge&quot; Wizard cards are the ONLY cards that can remove Plague Cards from your hand and therefore the game. Also important is the ability of the &quot;Purge-A-Card&quot; Wizard to remove ANY card from the game. The ability to remove Any card allows various opportunities to develop. In fact, sometimes the best play might not be to PURGE a Plague card. The choice is yours...&#10;&#10;",

The diabolical Doctor Necreaux has captured the world's top scientists and forced them to build a Doomsday Device. Your mission: Explore the Doctor's secret island lair, find the scientists, and escape in your shuttlecraft before the island is blown to Kingdom Come!&#10;&#10;In this simultaneous action game, players take one turn together as a team. At the start of each turn, you decide whether you're exploring or resting. When you explore you declare a speed, which represents how quickly you're exploring the island adventure deck and determines how many encounters your team will attempt to resolve this turn. You want to draw as many cards as you can because the scientists are hidden somewhere in the middle of the adventure deck, the escape shuttle is hidden in the bottom, and you have a limited number of turns before the island blows up. However, you can't be too fast or you'll fall prey to one of the island's many traps. If you choose to rest, your team gets to heal up and recharge.&#10;&#10;The Island of Doctor Necreaux incorporates creative ability manipulation (in assessing how player powers interact and applying them appropriately), press-your-luck (when selecting a speed and during combat), and resource management (deciding when to use charges - a scarce resource that fuels agent powers - and when to use a turn to rest instead of explore). The game comes with quick start rules and multiple variants to increase replayabiliy and adjust thr difficulty to accommodate a wide range of player skill. The island and agent skills are all card-based, making the island and the agents different every time.&#10;&#10;We at Invisible City are excited about the improvements in the second edition:&#10;&#10;&#10;     All-new full-color art.&#10;     Almost all cards have their own unique art.&#10;     Full-color art on card fronts and backs.&#10;     More &amp; better components. Bigger box (with room for expansions), better cards, bigger rules, enough dice for all players to play, etc.&#10;     Quick-start rules to make it easy for first time players to play.&#10;     All-new &quot;secret cache&quot; cards to adjust the game for different skill levels.&#10;     Clearer/better ways to increase the difficulty for experienced players.&#10;     All cards are numbered for easy set-up of pre-generated scenarios.&#10;     By popular BGG demand, the game's been re-tooled to use 2d6 as the primary resolution mechanic (instead of 1d6). The rules and every card have been re-written to accommodate this.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Highest number goes first, lowest number goes last, etc.&#10;&#10;To play: Spin arrow and move your token the number of spaces indicated on the spinner. If you land on your own color, take one Good and Plenty chip. If you land on a Good and Plenty's Grabber space, give one Good and Plenty chip back. You may go backwards instead of forwards ONLY if doing so will land you on your color so you can get a Good and Plenty chip. First player to reach the Finish space gets 3 Good and Plenty chips, Second player gets two, Third player gets 1. If there is a fourth player, they get none. Winner is the player who has the most Good and Plenty chips once all players reach the Finish space. If the Good and Plenty chips are depleted before all players reach the Finish space, winner is the player with the most Good and Plenty chips at that time.&#10;&#10;",

In fact, the games are so simple, the rules for the 4 included games each fit on a single card.&#10;&#10;Winning one of the Mana War games ranges from completing a grid of cards with unique rows and columns by yourself to a team effort of wit and luck to bluffing your way to be the sole winner in a cut-throat battle of memory and strategy.&#10;&#10;The main goal of Mana War was to create games which are so simple to learn, a small child or a drunk person could pick it up easily. This was achieved by having incredibly simple game components and designing game rules which challenge players to think logically while only needing to remember basic colors/shapes.&#10;&#10;",

To score points, players place Workers on the tiles they build to claim Rooms and Suites that are Under Construction.

Witches!!!As one of the club&rsquo;s supernatural enforcers it is the players' duty to conduct a witch hunt and capture as many of the coven as they dare.&#10;&#10;Ghost Hunter: Witches  is a card game for 2 or more players (up to 6 with one deck or 12 with two decks). Players must lay down higher and higher Witch cards until one can lay a set of three capturing all the cards on the table at that time. A player who cannot keep up with the witches being laid will be forced to pick up the stack and add it to their hand. Every captured card is worth points at the end of the game. Many cards have special rules that effect the order of play, who may capture or other game dynamics. Some cards are marked as 'innocent' meaning that if they are captured, which is often unavoidable, they are worth minus points at the end of the game. When the first player has gotten rid of all of their cards the game ends, then the player who has the most positive points wins overall with the others being ranked behind them based on their scores.&#10;&#10;The deck can be integrated with all the other Ghost Hunter decks like the blues Spirits deck or the red Vampires deck.&#10;&#10;So assemble your trusted associates, light your torches and prepare for the wickedness of Ghost Hunter: Witches.&#10;&#10;",

The goal is to split it apart, divide the spoils, and form complete dinosaur skeletons. Large dinosaurs are much more lucrative, but incomplete skeletons do not score!&#10;&#10;Using wooden sticks to divide the board, players collectively determine which tiles will be claimed and by whom. As the board splits and shrinks, players are pressured to finish what they've started before every fossil is claimed. Timing is everything, so sometimes it is best to take a partial turn and conserve resources for later. Each player also holds a unique single-use tool. This should be employed at the best moment for the greatest reward.&#10;&#10;Fossil Hunters is a short small-box game, taking only 20 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;",

This is due largely to the fact that many musicians are not sufficiently familiar with the positions of the notes of the musical scale to be able to recognize instantly a given note from its position, which is essential in sight reading. This is especially true of beginners or persons inexperienced in reading music.&quot; This game aims to teach the notes of the scale through game play. Includes board, 48 cards and 16 playing pieces, four of each color.&#10;&#10;The board has the treble staff and the bass staff running continuously around the board with the musical notes of the scale on them, with the name of the note in small letters. Players have four game pieces each. The object is to move through the notes of the scales to get all four game pieces to the W-I-N-S zone. The players turn cards to determine what letter of the scale to move to. At first they may need to refer to the names of the notes, but as the game is played, they will begin to recognize the position of the notes, aiding in their sight reading ability. Players may move any of their pieces, and may have to move backward in order to get to the note indicated. The first player to get all his pieces in the W-I-N-S zone is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

Stalin gave the order to finish up with Finland in order to concentrate on Operation Bagration that had just begun. Subsequently, Soviet forces had to first batter the fortified VKT-line then quickly break through toward the north.&#10;At the beginning, with the help of the 30th Guards army, the Soviet advance was slow but steady until they formed a salient near Ihantala. Attrition was great in both camps, but the arrival of the Finnish armoured division coupled with a particularly effective artillery fire changed the situation and the following counter-attack led to the pushing back of the Soviets.&#10;Finally, the Finnish forces succeeded with their last reserves and the German aviation to stabilize the lines. Stalin canceled the offensive and negotiated with the Finnish authorities to obtain the reversal of this former ally against the Germans. Finland was saved but at what cost!&#10;&#10;2. Continuing their rapid advance across the country of their new ally, Romania, the Soviets were engaged by the Hungarian 2nd army in Transylvania before arriving in the local capital Cluj. Confronted by the enemy avant-guard, the Hungarians went so far as to launch an offensive along the Mure&#197;&#159;. After a brief phase of surprise, the Stavka reacted by ordering the Soviet units present as well as the Romanian 4th army, in the process of reorganizing, to reach Turda and its pass. Attacks in several sectors along the Mure&#197;&#159; ensued that the Hungarian forces as well as the German reinforcements had a difficult time repelling.&#10;Even the 23rd Panzer Division struggled to contain the repeated assaults by the Soviet and Romanian forces. Fortunately for the Axis, the allied losses were such that the Stavka decided mid-October to circumvent Turda by the east.&#10;As the Soviet, will you be able to break through the front in a decisive way and as a member of the Axis, will you succeed in containing the red waves?&#10;&#10;Game components:&#10;&bull; One 59 x 41 cm map (printed front and back)&#10;&bull; 216 die-cut counters and markers&#10;&bull; 1 rule book with 7 scenarios including 2 campaigns&#10;&bull; 1 color player aid&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;",

      description: "A faction of the Japanese military had been looking for an excuse to extend Japanese control deeper into the Chinese mainland. When several Chinese monks were beaten, this faction paid thugs to fan anti-Japanese activities in the Chinese sector of Shanghai. Seizing the &ldquo;opportunity,&rdquo; a small force of naval infantry invaded Chapei, the all-Chinese northern section of the city of Shanghai. But the Japanese had not counted on the quick reaction and effective fighting of the Nationalist Chinese forces from nearby Nanjing. The initial Japanese thrust was thrown back quickly. It took repeated reinforcements over the next five weeks for the Japanese to push the Chinese out of the city and away from the Huangpo and Yangtze Rivers. Shanghai would become a major springboard for further Japanese advances, but the battle had taken its toll. This game covers those five weeks of fighting.&#10;&#10;Shanghai Incident uses the Fire &amp; Movement system designed around the realities of mechanized warfare, giving motorized and/or specially-trained units clear advantages. Players can augment units at the instant of combat with support fire, provided by weapons ranging from mortars through cannon and light ground attack aircraft to heavy bombers. A seemingly predictable assault can be overturned at the last minute by heavy defending fires, while even small units may develop tremendous offensive punch with the assistance of a heavy bombardment. Winning the battle is a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.&#10;&#10;The Japanese military has greater overall skill and firepower, although the Chinese have two German-trained divisions. Both players have manpower limitations that are eased only when the Japanese player calls a pause to his offensive. Both sides therefore have to weigh time and space against numbers. The player who strikes the best balance will emerge the victor.&#10;&#10;Skills:&#10;&#10;     Level: Regiment&#10;     Hex: .625 miles (1 km)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Turns are one season (three months) and units are brigade/regiment in strength, with assets such air air support represented as separate counters.

      description: "In early 1864, Union Gen. Nathaniel Banks led a small army up Louisiana's Red River. His objective, in conjunction with an overland campaign through Arkansas, was the Confederate Trans-Mississippi capital at Shreveport. Poor coordination of the two columns enabled the Confederates to concentrate their slender resources against each in turn. Banks was first, and in early April his spearhead was hit near the crossroads of Mansfield. Historically, the Union forces, strung out on the march, were routed piecemeal, but the battle could have gone the other way.&#10;&#10;Mansfield uses the simplified QuickPlay version of the Musket &amp; Saber system of warfare during the muzzle-loading era. Combat is based on unit quality rather than raw numbers, and rewards use of historical tactics. All units are susceptible to rout when weakened, so players must maintain reserves. Leaders enhance unit capabilities. Winning the battle depends on deployment, thoughtful maneuver to concentrate at the key points, the proper coordination of arms, careful use of leaders and special units, and an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each army.&#10;&#10;Scale:&#10;&#10;     Level: Brigade&#10;     Hex: 440 yards&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The White Dice that roll above the Blue Die do damage to your hero.&#10;&#10;If the Red Die rolls over the Blue Die then the Enemy you're attacking gets to activate their ability. This can be anything from an energy shield that protects the Enemy to a devastating counterattack or more.&#10;&#10;When you defeat an Enemy the Hero that you used gets to level up and heal, get stronger or gain powerful loot. Each Hero has two abilities that they can use to increase the chances of success. The only thing is that you have to choose which ability you want to activate, and you can only activate it once per game.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to take out all of the Enemies before your opponent takes out all of theirs.

The Allies used this time to build up their strength and the 8th Army was formed. Before dawn on 18 November, the 8th Army was ready to strike and the Allies launched a sweeping offensive into the Axis controlled Cyrenaica (Eastern Libya) in order to relieve the besieged fortress of Tobruk. After a series of swirling battles, the Axis had to withdraw and the siege was lifted.&#10;&#10;Michael Gustavsson, co-designer of FAB: Golan&rsquo;73 is back with volume IV in the Fast Action Battle series. In this game, as the Allied player, you control the XXX and XIII corps, Tobruk Garrison and the Strategic Reserve force of the 8th Army. As the Axis player, you control the DAK (Deutsches Afrika Korps), the Italian XXI corps and the Corpo d&rsquo; Armata di Manovra (CAM) of the Panzergruppe Afrika commanded by the famous Erwin Rommel. Units in the game represents regiments/brigades and some battalions, while assets are mostly battalion size and turns are 1-2 days in time.&#10;&#10;In FAB: Crusader you will see features like Motorized Infantry units, higher stacking limits, Tank Refit, Italian Trieste Reserve Division, Ghost Units, Fortified areas, Realistic Armor treatment, Special Reconnaissance Unit Capabilities, movement points to trace Supply and Divisional Integrity rules, a new Combat Matrix and other rules for transferring the system to desert warfare.&#10;&#10;Assets include Machine Gun Battalions, Allied &quot;I&quot; Tanks, Powerful German 88&rsquo;s (AT) and more. Various events are included such as Air Missions, Allied Rapid Response, The Beta Convoy, British LRDG Commando Raid, Naval Bombardment and German Auftragstaktik, Command Confusion among others. The game also have optional rules to enhance realism such as Allied Armor Doctrine, Probe Attacks, Italian SNAFU Check and German Momentum.&#10;&#10;This battle will provide interesting challenges to both sides: Will the Allies try a risky breakout from Tobruk, and will it be relieved, will Rommel go for a dash to the wire, will Allied replacements outlast Axis fuel and supply, will the Italians crumble or hold? Now, it is up to YOU to find out&hellip;&#10;&#10;",

One of these has an illustration on the front, the other a few sentences written in the first person listing characteristic traits or related facts; both have the name of the species on the back.&#10;&#10;Several ways to use the cards are suggested, such as employing them in group exercises (e.g. sorting cards by categories or shared traits) or for a scoreless solo matching game. When played competitively, the rules suggest dividing an arbitrary number of participants (like a class of pupils) into two teams, potentially with a moderator (like a teacher) to read out clues from the text cards. The teams then try to collect pairs of cards either by identifying the species on a given picture card, gaining an additional point if they don't need any clues to do so, or by selecting the right picture card based on the clues from the corresponding text card.&#10;&#10;In addition to Skogen, the series includes the entries Insj&ouml;n (The Lake), &Auml;ngen (The Meadow), Havet (The Sea), Fj&auml;llet (The Fell), and Staden (The City).&#10;&#10;",

Players control a Hero with unique abilities as they explore the open-world map, defeating Encounters and gaining Treasure on their quest for victory. A core set of simple rules that make it quick to get started, but multiple Scenarios to choose from allow players to either work together in a cooperative game, or go head-to-head for victory in a competitive game. This variety of scenarios provides the option of either a lighter game or one with more depth.&#10;&#10;Each game starts with the Heroes in central town, from there players choose their own path. The map is divided into several areas with their own types of increasingly difficult Encounters - beginning to the relative ease of the Plains, into the dense Forests further out, then giving way to the dangers of the ancient Ruins. In the furthest reaches, players will find a variety of unique points of interest, like the Great Tree or Eternal Volcano, which will be their goal for many of the unique Quests. There are also the Fallen Palaces, home to the great Fiends - the most challenging Encounter for any Hero.&#10;&#10;The Encounter system is the heart of most turns in every Scenario. After moving, players draw an Encounter card matching the type of space they are in. There are two options for how to approach each Encounter, each corresponding to one of the 4 stats - Combat, Agility, Magic, or Intelligence. Players must use try to determine which stat they think each option is and evaluate their various bonuses to determine which option is best for them. After deciding, you'll flip the card over to see the required stat and target number, then roll the die and add your bonuses. Win and you get a Treasure, lose and you're down a Heart. Lose all your Hearts and you must spend the next turn healing up at the nearest Camp. At any point during your turn you can choose to use one of your Hero's unique powers to help you in a number of ways.&#10;&#10;BraveGuard was developed with the goal of being a game that offers seasoned gamers a quick &amp; compelling adventure, but also offers enough clarity and lighter options to be welcoming to new gamers...young or old! At it's core the game offers choice every turn, character development, and serves as an introduction to the core concepts to help create the next generation of serious gamers!&#10;&#10;",

Each move is either the placement of a stone from their stock into a pile on the board, or moving any number of neutral stones and/or stones of their color from one pile to another, in order to create a number piles with 'primacy' in their player color.

If you land on a clock with a question mark, everyone calls out 'What's the time Mr. Wolf?', and you pick up a tile.

Turn over the tile to the analogue image, if it matches the big clock, place the tile on one of your player board spaces. If the image and analogue clock does not match, return the tile back to the pile.

Reallocation Phase - Move your Units card first between your World cards, and then to other player's World cards that you intend to attack.&#10;&#10;4. Conquest Phase - You resolve the Conquest Actions at each World card that you reallocated Fleets or Troops to.&#10;&#10;5. Victory Phase - Determine the spoils of your Conquest Actions, liberate World cards, pay for more face down World cards, determine if you have enough Victory points to win, and draw back to hand size.&#10;&#10;The game is meant to be won through conquest, as purchasing World cards from your System Deck gets incrementally expensive, and you'll use Tactics cards in battle. Character cards also will tip the balance of power by affecting Conquest Actions, altering allocations and other game mechanics including neutralizing other Characters!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Will you be a helpful addition to the community, becoming the Apothecary, or will you be a snake oil salesperson, only in it for a quick buck before moving on to the next town?&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;Apothecary is a medieval-themed game of medicine-making and disease management for 2-4 players. You and your friends play competing herbalists who have set up shop in a small town.

You will have the choice to actually treat or filmflam the villagers with snake oil&mdash;but watch out&mdash;too much lying and you&rsquo;ll get run out of town.

If one player is Run Out (the other end of the track), the player(s) who were not Run Out and who have the most money win the game.&#10;&#10;",

Players then choose one from their hand each turn, and place it face down in front of themselves.  All of those cards are then simultaneously revealed.

Following defeats along the Suez Canal the Ottoman government forcibly evacuated the civilians of Gaza and began fortifying the town and nearlby high ground. The Allied forces occupied the Sinai but could only slowly build up forces for a sustained offensive, and only after extensive work was completed on rail lines and water pipeline from Egypt. In the Spring of 1917 this work was completed and both sides prepared for a fight. In the meantime the Ottoman Empire had won significant victories over the Allies at the Gallipoli peninsula, and in Iraq where a British and Indian army were compelled to surrender after a grueling siege. The Allies brought to Gaza hundreds of artillery, the largest concentration of this weaponry outside of the Western Front, including gas chemical shells, as well as tanks. The Ottomans had also rushed reinforcements, including veterans who were at Gallipoli, German advisors, and aircraft.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?

The game allows solitaire play.&#10;&#10;In this game, there are 55 cards numbered 1-10, and the number on the card equals to the number of that card in the game. Of these 55 cards, the deck is shuffled and thirty-five cards are placed on the table. Players take turns playing cards from their hand to remove cards from the table.&#10;&#10;Before the game starts, the players make a tableau of 35 cards, in overlapping skewed rows. Some are face up, some are face-down. (Place five of them in the first row. Then place next five cards in the second row, covering half of the previous row, sliding half of the card length rightward. Continue placing until the seventh row is made. By doing so, only the bottom (seventh) row is fully visible, and most of the cards are partially hidden by two cards of the next row.)&#10;&#10;During your turn, you play a card from your hand to remove a fully visible card of the same value. Alternatively, you play two cards from your hand to remove a fully visible card whose value equals to the sum or difference of your two cards.&#10;&#10;After you remove a card from the table, new cards can be fully visible. If there is a pair of fully visible cards of the same value, they are removed immediately. Continue this chain reaction until no pair is made.&#10;&#10;When you can't remove any card by playing from your hand, you must spend a joker to remove any one card. All players lose the game if five jokers are spent and still you can't remove any card.&#10;&#10;All players win the game when all cards are removed from the table.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;Rescue the people trapped in the kingdom! A co-operative card game using a total of 55 cards, from one &ldquo;1&rdquo; card to ten &ldquo;10&rdquo; cards.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn uses cards to make pairs with the cards in the center to remove them. The players are considered as the winners if all the cards in the center are removed. Although you may not talk about the numbers in your hand, you may form a strategy based on the number of cards of each type and aim for a win by communicating with your fellow players.

The density of counters in each scenario is low, allowing you to see and experience the big picture of the battle.&#10;&#10;Rebel Fury places you, the player, in the role of the Army Commander (Lee, Burnside, Hooker, Bragg, Rosecrans, Grant).  You maneuver your army to find the enemy&rsquo;s flanks, concentrate your forces for an attack, and determine where to commit your artillery assets.&#10;&#10;Units are portrayed at the Infantry/Cavalry division level. The Civil War Heritage Series game system features a new Zone of Influence/Zone of Control mechanic that controls unit formation (March/Battle) based on their proximity to your opponent. As your units close with the enemy, your forces naturally break into battle formation, where they then maneuver the last distance to engage. Unlike most hex and counter wargames, this system allows you total freedom to move units in any order multiple times, unleashing the full range of historical tactics in a simple and clean format.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The Patriot player controls the Argentine Ruling Directory forces and various federated and allied forces, while the Royalist player controls Spanish Regular Army, trained Loyalist South American forces and militia units. Several other historical armed factions contend for each player's attention when formulating strategy, from a land grabbing Portuguese-Brazilian Imperialist army, to local guerrilla units, breakaway Federal Republics, and a native Incan Rebellion in the Andes Highlands. Each player will face similar daunting logistical and political challenges as they attempt to impose their military will on their opponents over a vast theater of operations spanning Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, and parts Bolivia &amp; Brazil.&#10;&#10;Libertadores del Sur is an operational level simulation with a point to point card driven game system. Each turn represents one year's campaigning season. The players have a chance to raise and reorganize new forces prior to beginning operations, and reset their sides' morale, depending on how many provinces they control. During the Operations phase, players take turns playing cards causing historical events and/or activate forces to move and attack. Operations continue until the player's run out of cards, or run out of morale. When operations end, the players have a chance to consolidate political control over provinces where they drove out enemy forces, and combat units fall back to controlled areas. There are three scenarios allowing the players to start at different points of the campaign. The 1810 scenario starts with the first of the local juntas establishing themselves in response to Napoleon's invasion of the Iberian Peninsula. The 1814 scenario begins with Argentine General San Martin superseding Argentine General Belgrano, and the Patriots attempting to recover from various strategic set-backs. The 1817 scenario is a mini-game covering only the liberation of Chile.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Trophies are awarded to the player who makes the most profit from each race, either through prizemoney, bet winnings, payouts from players' cards or through horse sales.&#10;&#10;There are three types of trophies on offer. Races 1-3 are known as Maiden Races, and are the least valuable. Trophies awarded for these races are bronze in colour and worth only 1 point each. &#10;Prize money for winning owners in the three maiden races are 1x the Profits (100k for a win, 75k for second place and 50k for third).&#10;&#10;Races 4-6 are known as Handicap races, and are more valuable. Trophies awarded for each of these three races are silver in colour and worth 2 points each. Winning horse owners get 2 x the profits if their horses finish top 3 (200k for a win, 150k for second and 100k for third).&#10;&#10;Finally, races 7 and 8 are known as the Feature Races and are the most valuable, worth three points. Prizemoney is tripled for these two races (300k for a win, 225k for second place and 150k for third). The trophies awarded for these two races are gold in colour.&#10;&#10;Beat The Bookie can be played with 2-8 players. At the beginning of a race meet, a player is nominated to act as the Bookie. The Bookie is a banker of sorts, and is responsible for auctioning the horses, collecting money, calling the horses, laying the horse cards on the track and settling any successful or unsuccessful bets. The Bookie also assigns the trophies are the end of each of the 8 races, but counting up the winnings of each player. The Bookie can also play as a player, but must keep their cash wallet and assets separate from that of the main 'bank'.&#10;&#10;Once a Bookie has been assigned, each player is provided with 300k of Beat The Bookie currency. This is to form each players 'cash wallet'. Player are also given six Bet Slip cards, which depict the names and pictures of each of the horses in the field. These cards are used to place the players' bets.&#10;&#10;The Bookie then conducts the pre-meet auction, and auctions off each of the six horses in the race, with a reserve price of 100k. Players may or may not bid on the horses, with the successful/highest bidder awarded an ownership card for the particular horse bought. The new owner must keep the ownership card until he/she elects to sell the horse to another player or back to the Bookie.&#10;&#10;Once the pre-meet auction has concluded, all players must draw a players card from the left hand panel of the game board. If a player owns a horse, they must draw an Owners Card, which features any fees due or payable to/from the Bookie for their horse. Even if a player owns multiple horses, they need only draw one Owners Card. If a player does not own any horses, they must draw a Punters Card, which offers a special or exotic for the upcoming race. Finally, the Bookie must draw a Bookies Card, which features the odds for the upcoming race. Players can then bet on the odds provided by the Bookies Card, by overturning their Bet Slip Card to reveal the name of the horse they intend to bet on, and placing their chosen bet amount on top of the Bet Slip Card.&#10;&#10;Once all bets are placed and accepted by the Bookie, the Bookie then shuffles the Horse Card deck. There are six cards for each of the six different horses. The Bookie then lays the cards out in order of the Horse, with each horse advancing once space down the game board each time it is drawn. The Bookie draws all the Horse Cards until there is a winner, a second place getter and a third place getter.&#10;&#10;At the conclusion of the race. The Bookie pays out the prize money to the winning owners. If a horse, that finishes first, second or third, is not owned, no prizemoney is awarded in respect of that horse. For races 1-3 (Maiden Races), the Bookie awards 1x the Profits. For races 4-6 (Handicap Races) the Bookie awards 2x the Profits and for races 7 and 8 (Feature Races), the Bookie awards 3 x the Profits.&#10;&#10;The Bookie must then payout any prizemoney owed under Punters Cards. Once done so, or if no prizemoney is awarded, the Punter must place his Punters Card back under the pile.&#10;&#10;Once prizemoney and punters payouts are awarded, the Bookie either pays out or collects on players' bets on the calculation provided for by the Bookies Card. If the Bookies Card showed odds of 4:1, and the player bet 10k, the Bookie must pay the player 40k. Unsuccesful bets are collected by the Bookie and placed back in the 'bank'.&#10;&#10;When all prize money and bet money is awarded, players must count their profits. A trophy (bronze for Maiden Races, silver for Handicap Races and gold for Feature Races) is provided to the player with the most profit from that race. The player keeps the trophy with their cash wallet for counting at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Once trophies are awarded, all players draw their players cards again ahead of the next race.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the players then count the value of their trophies. Bronze trophies are worth 1 point, Silvers are worth 2, and Golds are worth 3. A Player could win the game by not having won any feature races. Conversely, a player might head into race 7 not having won any races for the entire meet, and could win races 7 and 8 and win the game.&#10;&#10;Players can trade their horses with other players at the conclusion of any races for an agreed price. Horses are valuable as they provide an alternative revenue stream. Horses drawn frequently in races may be worth selling, as chance would mean it's unlikely to win again. Players who do not purchase horses at the initial pre-meet auction may wish to purchase horses ahead of the more valuable Feature Races.&#10;&#10;A player is eliminated if they are declared bankrupt and have no more money or horses to play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Now he turns his attention to the last war of the Roman Republic, to the marching of Legions and the sailing of fleets, to the rise of Augustus and the fall of Marc Antony and the savvy Queen of Egypt, Cleopatra.&#10;&#10;In &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; each player must raise troops and build ships, using these military forces to enact their will and conduct campaigns against the enemy. Along the way, they will face the challenges inherent in ancient warfare: the difficulty of keeping troops supplied, perilous storms at sea, the spreading of plagues, and the opportunistic assaults of Rome&rsquo;s external enemies. As the war wears on, both sides will attempt to chip away at the other&rsquo;s prestige and standing. If your prestige falls low enough, your troops and provinces might defect, tipping the balance. And should it fall to zero, you lose this high stakes battle. The winner shall rule over an empire. The loser? Well, as Octavian said before Cleopatra&rsquo;s son was strangled, two Caesars are one too many.&#10;&#10;The spoils of victory and the consequences of defeat might not be quite as serious as all that when the troops are made of cardboard, but Antony and Cleopatra allows you to refight this epic contest for ultimate power in the relative safety of your home or gaming club.&#10;&#10;Though somewhat more granular and detailed than Mr. Theissen&rsquo;s other games for Hollandspiele, this remains a quick, compelling, and accessible exploration of this fascinating subject.&#10;&#10;",

Roll to attack! &#10;It is that simple. Well... So it seems.&#10;&#10;The beginner rules are great for those new to tactical style games.  &#10;Those more familiar with Tactical warfare games will enjoy the intermediate and advanced rules.  These rules allow you to make the game a little more difficult, testing the strategy skills of your friends and yourself! &#10;Will you use tactical ramming to cause more damage before you give the full broadside? Or will you use a hit and run tactic with your small, fast ships?&#10;  &#10;Finally, the versatile campaign options let you have a fleet you can boast over&hellip;! Until they are sent to Davy Jones&rsquo; Locker, that is!&#10;&#10;Sea of War was created to give those that love tactical play a chance to get their friends involved without having to spend hours to learn.

This system is ideal for multiplayer games.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll need a few miniatures for the period (based singly, both 2x2cm or 1-inch diameter round bases are ok), some rulers or other measuring sticks and a few 6-sided dice, which we&rsquo;ll call d6. You&rsquo;ll also need markers to show who is &ldquo;Shaken&rdquo; and a figure&rsquo;s weapon reloading status. Some markers are available&#10;in the appendix.&#10;&#10;The game can be played on 90x90cm or 120x120cm tables with 28mm miniatures or 60x60cm when using 15mm.&#10;&#10;The scale of the game is: 1 figure = 1 man; 1cm is equivalent to 2m in real-life when using 20mm or 25/28mm miniatures, while it is 4m when using 15mm models. A turn represents 10-20 seconds. You can halve the distances when using 15mm miniatures. All measurements are taken from base to base. A miniature can shoot with a 180&deg; arc, Groups with a 90&deg; arc (45&deg; per side). In order to simplify the rules we ask players to use their common sense to decide shooting priorities. There must not be any intervening miniatures on the shooting line unless they are in base contact as in a 2nd rank (only) shooting. In theory, you should give priority to the target that is in front of you rather than one that is behind. You can always target a mounted miniature behind a foot figure.&#10; Additionally rules are provided for: Cavalry, Artillery, Religion, Weather all manner of Medieval Things!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

      description: "Perpetual Anarchy is a game for the &quot;2019 Two-Player PnP Design Contest&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;OVERVIEW&#10;Perpetual Anarchy is a strategic 2-player game using a standard 52-card deck. Players are states in a world of international anarchy, attempting to impose their supremacy on the other state. Choose the money allocation between immediate benefit with armaments and wealth and long-lasting benefit with military and civil technologies. Finally, establish the state policy: focus on producing, defensing or attacking.&#10;&#10;Perpetual Anarchy features bluff, push-your-luck and simultaneous action selection.&#10;&#10;GAME THEORY&#10;Perpetual Anarchy was inspired by game theory researches, especially by the PhD student in political science Nathan Alexander Sears' article: Simulating War and Peace in IR Theory with a Classroom Game&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;1 scoring board&#10;1 technology board&#10;28 cards (from an ordinary 52-card deck)&#10;6 tokens&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;Each player has 3 personal tokens (one for the scoring board and two for the technology board) and 14 cards in hand:&#10;&#10;     11 numbered cards: two 0s (10s), two 1s, two 2s, two 3s, one 4s, one 5, one 6.&#10;     3 action cards: attack (King), defense (Jack), production (Queen).&#10;&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;The game is divided in multiple rounds. In each round, there are three phases. At the end of a round, players pick up all of their played cards back into their hands ready for immediate re-use.&#10;&#10;Phase 1: Card Playing&#10;Players place 5 face-down card in a row on the table simultaneously. From left to right:&#10;&#10;1. the action card (attack, defense or production);&#10;2. it is a numbered card representing wealth allocation;&#10;3. it is a numbered card representing armament allocation;&#10;4. it is a numbered card representing civil tech allocation;&#10;5. it is a numbered card representing military tech allocation.&#10;&#10;There are some restrictions on playing numbered cards:&#10;&#10;     Each state has a budget of 7 billion per round, so they have to choose how to allocate it: the sum of number of the player&rsquo;s cards has to be 7 or less. Unused budget is lost.&#10;     The maximum military tech allocation is 2, so it is possible to play only 0, 1 or 2 for military tech&#10;     The maximum civil tech allocation is 2, so it is possible to play only 0, 1 or 2 for civil tech&#10;&#10;&#10;When both players have placed their cards, every card is turned face-up. If a player wrongly played cards exceeding the sum limit of 7, the opponent decides which card or cards to decrease in order to be within 7. If both players make a mistake in the same round, the round is considered null and void.&#10;&#10;Phase 2: Peace/War Scoring&#10;If a state attacks the other one or both states attack, a war begins. Otherwise, states are at peace.&#10;Based on the cards played and the tech levels, states score points as explained below.&#10;&#10;Phase 3: Tech Increasing&#10;If a state didn&rsquo;t lose the war in the round, it can increase its tech levels based on its tech allocations.&#10;&#10;PEACE&#10;If a state at peace chooses the production action, he scores as many points as the value on its played wealth card + civil tech level.&#10;&#10;If a state at peace chooses the defense action, he scores as many points as the value on its played wealth card -1 (reputation cost).&#10;&#10;WAR&#10;A state&rsquo;s firepower is the sum of its armament allocation, military tech level and action bonus:&#10;&#10;     Production: +0 action bonus.&#10;     Attack: +1 action bonus.&#10;     Defense: +2 action bonus.&#10;&#10;&#10;If states are at war, whoever has the higher firepower wins the war.&#10;&#10;If production or defense wins the war: it scores its own wealth allocation + the opponent&rsquo;s one.&#10;If attack wins the war: it scores its own wealth allocation + the opponent&rsquo;s one - 1 (reputation cost).&#10;&#10;When production or defense lose the war, it scores nothing and it loses its tech allocations.&#10;When attack loses the war, it scores -1 and it loses its tech allocations.&#10;&#10;ARMISTICE&#10;In case of equal firepower, the war ends with an armistice: attack scores its own wealth allocation &ndash; 1; production and defense score their own wealth allocation. Tech allocations are not lost.&#10;&#10;MILITARY TECH&#10;A state can allocate part of its budget researching tech for military purposes. The number on the military tech card, namely the military tech allocation, determines how many steps a state can progress on the military tech board. The resolution of military tech cards occurs after the peace/war scoring.&#10;&#10;Initially, the military tech level is 0; then, every 4 steps, a state increases its military tech level by 1. The military tech level contributes to a state&rsquo;s firepower.&#10;&#10;If a state is defeated, he loses its military tech allocation (but it doesn&rsquo;t lose its military tech level).&#10;&#10;CIVIL TECH&#10;A state can allocate part of its budget researching tech for civil purposes. The number on the civil tech card, namely the civil tech allocation, determines how many steps a state can progress on the civil tech board. The resolution of civil tech cards occurs after the peace/war scoring.&#10;&#10;Initially, the civil tech level is 0; then, every 3 steps, a state increases its civil tech level by 1. The civil tech level contribute to increase the efficiency in the production processes: the civil tech level contributes to the score of a production state at peace.&#10;&#10;If a state is defeated, he loses its civil tech allocation (but it doesn&rsquo;t lose its civil tech level).&#10;&#10;END OF THE GAME AND SCORING&#10;The game ends when the first player gets 50 or more. Before the beginning of the game, players may arrange to play for less or more points.&#10;At the end of the game, the player who has more points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Within an unending world of inscrutable science, radiation storms and machines dedicated to exterminating life, players create narrative stories and rewarding tactical gameplay in an open-model skirmish ruleset.&#10;&#10;Distinct in our design is an emphasis on mobility, vertical space, and accomplishing asymmetrical objectives before escaping to safety. Your tactical decisions and smart positioning will decide every encounter with the enemy. The world itself is lethal, but can you adapt your strategy, characters and exotic weapons to meet the challenge against both other players, and solo/cooperative scenarios?&#10;&#10;Combining inspirations from small-scale tabletop wargames, campaign skirmish games, RPGs and tactical turn-based video games, Zone Raiders is a fusion of what we love best about all of these.&#10;&#10;We wanted to strike the right chord between tactical depth of play, narrative campaigns and character development along with a commitment to streamlined rules while maintaining sophistication. Combined with a stunningly alien scifi setting that is vast enough to encompass many themes as a player's imagination can conjure, it's a game meant to scratch an itch we've felt for ages.&#10;&#10;Or on a more direct note Have you ever wanted to play a game where you could...&#10;&#10;&#10;     Grappling Hook to tall ledges, snipe foes, then dive to safety?&#10;     Wallrun up a steep slope, and kick a bad guy over a railing to their doom?&#10;     Fight AI Monsters issuing from an automated factory, then lure them into a nest of explosive barrels before blowing the lot up?&#10;     Open an cryo-vault to rescue an ancient survivor with lost knowledge?&#10;     Project force-field bridges across vast gaps, only to turn them off when foes set foot on them?&#10;     Combine versus and cooperative play into a single ruleset, with stealth and objective focused mechanics?&#10;&#10;&#10;All of these are within the domain of Zone Raiders.&#10;&#10;We are an Open-Model game, meaning that the rules and setting are designed for what miniatures you may have and adore. There's numerous fantastic manufacturers out there, and many of us certainly have collections ourselves. Additionally, creating your own group and their stories is all the easier as inspiration can be drawn from all the beautiful models our greater gaming community has created.&#10;&#10;Game Features&#10;&#10;Zone Raiders has a mixture of elements veteran players will both feel familiar with, and refreshed by.

Practical rule design ensures that no decision is without appropriate consequence.&#10;      Tactical Team Skirmish - Build a Raid Team of 6-12 hardened survivors in your quest to endure. Equip each one with different weapons and specialized skills and watch them grow... or die.&#10;      Dynamic Movement - Feel the mobility of our unique Dynamic Movement system, where your Raiders can be equipped to parkour, wallrun, grapple or powered vault across broken terrain and lethal gaps. Smash opponents off tall ledges, or create forcefield walls to trap them in place!&#10;      Deadly Environments - Your opponent is not the only threat on the battlefield. Protecting ancient relics and scavenge are automated exterminator machines, psionic mind-scorchers, fierce nano-contaminant storms and radiation fluxes. When the lights vanish or unexpected snipers arise during a Dark Emergence Event, can your forces adapt?&#10;      Diverse Factions - Command 7 unique factions with engaging playstyles, from the regimented Reclaimers, the agile Technomads, cunning Zone Stalkers to the evolving robotic NthGen, each force is dripping with flavor and tactical options as well as unique researchable doctrines and equipment.&#10;      Campaign System - Lead your team beyond a single battle, but to victory in a campaign where your strategic decisions have great importance. Will you build up your team's tech skills, or abort the mission to retrieve an ancient cryopod? Should your team construct a mighty industrial robot, or develop maps of the battleground for a tactical edge? &#10;      Asymmetric Missions - Winning a battle isn't the same as winning a war. Players can elect  different goals during a mission, from capturing prisoners to hacking an automated train. Perhaps it's worth it to cut your losses during a failed mission, or even change objectives mid game as a new, more valuable prize is discovered!&#10;      Exotic Equipment - Featuring over 100 different types of weapons, armor and survival gear, you will have numerous options on how to equip and defeat your foes. &#10;      Merciless AI Enemies - The Immunocytes are merciless machines that are anathema to all intelligent life.

      description: "TorKings is the game connoisseur&rsquo;s (geek-worthy) extreme upgrade of the classic game of alignment.&#10;&#10;There&rsquo;s new rules, new game options and hardware from the distant future. It's now a whole lot more than the old game of line up 4!&#10;&#10;The games now range from the classic game of Align4 (4 in a row) to TorLord &ndash; the creative mode where you win title of TorLord or TorKing and the right to change and evolve your own rules of engagement with a diversified set of tokens.&#10;&#10;In between those games are the games of TorGalor and TorKings &ndash; both radical and massive improvements to the game of alignment that truly unleash the genre&rsquo;s strategic depth and gameplay diversity to the next level.&#10;&#10;Then there&rsquo;s the new interactive cooperative team play mode that blows the dynamics out of the water even further.   A game mode that really hits the sweet spot with satisfying, engaging fun for families and friends.&#10;New Developmental Tool:  With both enhanced strategy games and interactive cooperative team play, TorKings is a new cross purposed STEM and Social IQ building tool.  Idea for developing minds and team building alike.&#10;&#10;The Geek Spectrum:  TorKings gameplay is adaptive to suit the full spectrum of players. Pick your board size, pick your game and pick your team.  Wherever you lie on the spectrum &ndash; there&rsquo;s a game option to suit.&#10;&#10;As immersive and fun as good Euro-games are they are unfortunately cursed by lengthy rules that are difficult to access, long gameplay and lengthy setup.&#10;&#10;TorKings is a complete matrix of game options to suit your occasion. The rules are super accessible, the game depth is selectable from newb to guru, the game duration is also selectable, the setup practically instant, you can play on a single, double or triple sized board and you can play one-on-one or play interactively in teams! &ndash; That&rsquo;s one freaking convenient and dynamic piece of gameware!&#10;&#10;So players of all ages can dive into the fun of the game of their choice in no time. &ndash; Quick, easy, super engaging and a load of fun!&#10;&#10;Way Back: The classic game of alignment goes back 5 decades (released as Connect4 in 1974). It&rsquo;s one of the most popular board games in the western world.  We&rsquo;ve either grown up with it (or a clone) or we&rsquo;ve been adults with kids who have played it to infinity and beyond.&#10;&#10;But it&rsquo;s a classic - so why change it?  The answer is that the gameplay is massively underdeveloped!&#10;The telling proof of that is the general attrition of the game by the time players hit their tweens. Albeit - they then grow up and return to the game for a similar time period with their own kids!&#10;&#10;The reasons for tween attrition are many but the most important factor is that the gameplay of chasing a single alignment is not strategically rich enough to maintain interest for naturally expanding minds.  It&rsquo;s too confined, too routine and lacks diversity.  If only those problems could be fixed&hellip;&#10;&#10;By comparison other strategic games like Go and Chess have a good following as minds mature.  Those games have the strategic richness to match and engage evolving minds.&#10;But how do you make the game of alignment strategically richer to engage growing and mature minds? The answer is layered but here are the basic elements of the solution: &#10;1.    Kill the sudden death approach. &#10;   &bull;    Getting a single alignment is fun.  But getting multiple alignments is a lot more fun - so in the new rules a side wins by getting the most alignments in a game.&#10;   &bull;    That finally opens up the new possibility of getting more points for multiple alignments.&#10;   &bull;    As the game plays on through alignments there is a far richer move and counter-move dynamic set up.   The dynamic shift to achieving the more dynamic multiple alignments while of course blocking the bigger game or your opponent.&#10;   &bull;    Such a simple and obvious rule change &ndash; but with a massive cascade of instantly compounding strategic depth and dynamics&#10;&bull;    You now also get paid for each new alignment you make - from your opponents unplayed tokens.  That&rsquo;s also the super simple way you keep score! Again super satisfying and adding another layer of risk management, separation anxiety and competitive dynamics. &ndash; Genius!&#10;2.    Expand the game board size&#10;   &bull;    Modular board games allow the board to get wider and that finally allows the strategic development to expand.  The result - a massive increase in player engagement and satisfaction.&#10;3.    Introduce a diversity of token characters with new properties to meaningfully contribute to the gameplay and diversify game options further.  A satisfying upgrade for seasoned strategists.&#10;4.    Open up interactive co-op team play&#10;   &bull;    The modular boards are a total natural fit for others to join and play interactive cooperative team games.  The result is a further cascade in dynamics as the human element is introduced.  It&rsquo;s easily one of the most fun ways to play. It&rsquo;s also one of the most accessible co-op styled board-games in the world! A true contender that may finally bring cooperative styled boardgaming into the mainstream!&#10;Flexibility: The options above can be toggled on or off in different game options to allow players to grow into the new gameplay levels.  Combining all of the above entirely unleashes the true potential of the strategic alignment genre.  Once you play the new games it feels strange indeed that it&rsquo;s taken 5 decades to finally make this most obvious transition.&#10;&#10;The Revolutionary New Hardware:&#10;   &bull;    Smart Tokens: Now your tokens finally sort themselves and shoot straight back at you at the press of a button.  That gives you more game time and turns the tedious task of manually sorting tokens into a magic treat for everyone, every game!&#10;   &bull;    Modular Gameboards: Players can now join up to 3 boards together to make a bigger fully integrated board.  The result is a massive boost to gameplay diversity and depth.&#10;   &bull;    Iconic 3D tokens:  We&rsquo;ve turned design thinking inside out when we developed the TorKings tokens.  They are a mixture of sculpted 3D forms and voids beautifully framed by the surrounding torus.  They are a breakthrough in visual accessibility that allows token diversity to explode along with gameplay depth.  They are also very tactile and visually stunning in the game grid.&#10;   &bull;    Snap Latch : We&rsquo;ve put an end to the violation of your tokens randomly releasing in the middle of your game.  The snap latch snaps shut and secures your game.&#10;   &bull;    Spinners:  The tokens can spin in a variety of ways.  They are handy as timers, selectors and impressively cool play things in their own right.&#10;   &bull;    Safety:  The tokens re designed to allow airflow regardless of orientation in an airway. That allows parents to breathe a little easier when younger kids inadvertently wander into the mix.&#10;   &bull;    Premium Quality: We&rsquo;ve designed the game to be a very different premium journey for players of all ages. It&rsquo;s a completely new level of enjoyment and fun.&#10;&#10;Description from the designer - James T.&#10;&#10;",

Dividing his forces into two columns, Harrison ordered General Winchester to join up with a smaller force of Michigan volunteers at Frenchtown, south of Detroit along the River Raisin while he led another column that would follow later after they assembled from scattered winter quarters. The volunteers and a small detachment that escaped from Detroit at Frenchtown beat back an earlier attack by Canadian militia and their First Nation American allies. Learning of the larger US force coming from the south, British General Proctor left Detroit in the midst of the winter weather to deal with the growing US threat at the River Raisin.

      description: "Taumant's Lair is a dice game for a single player with a duration of approximately 20 minutes. To play you need six six-sided dice, each not exceeding 0.5 inches, about eight pawns, and a dozen counters or tokens. If you do not have any pawns nor counters.&#10;The game is divided into three different parts, each corresponding to three pages, which you will use as game boards. Print each one on a different sheet of cardboard and follow their instructions.&#10;&#10;Part I: Recruiting Adventurers&#10;The first step to penetrate Taumant's lair is to form a party capable of surviving its many hazards. Luckily, you are near to the city-state of Kalazar, located between two kingdoms at war. It makes Kalazar the perfect place to look for adventurers. You must explore the city and try to recruit people prepared to risk their lives.&#10;&#10;Part II: The Dungeon&#10;It's the time! Your party is about to get into the cavern. Your goal is to get through its six levels with as few losses as possible. You will play six turns, each corresponding one level of the cave. Put the pawns representing your adventurers on the appropriate square of the column 'ready' and another one on the first level of the dungeon. If you beat the sixth level, you will face Taumant in Part III with your surviving adventurers!&#10;&#10;Part III: Taumant!&#10;You have arrived at Taumant's chamber. This will be a tough fight! As soon as he meets the adventurers, he prepares himself to reduce his enemies to ashes with his deadly fire breath. You have only three turns before he buries your party in a hell of flames. Every unwounded adventurer has a roll for every turn. Put this sheet 12 inches from you and roll a die towards the dragon; if it stops on him, you will cause damage points depending on its location. If you cause 50 or more damage points, you win! Otherwise, you can return to Part I and try again.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

As you explore the three Islands, you will develop a map to help you along the way. You will also need to collect or buy wood to build a raft so you can cross to the next island. Two of the Islands have Tribal Chiefs that are hidden and you must find. These Chiefs will each give you half of the secret location of the temple.&#10;&#10;The Chief will either greet you with hostility or friendship depending on how you treat his people. As you explore you will come across different types of villages that you can trade with or overtake if necessary. Some will be hostile and automatically attack you while others will be friendly. Keep track of your food because if you run out your crew will start to die from starvation. Try to obtain medicine in case your crew get sick from the natives. Once you've spoke with both Chiefs you will have the secret location and can travel to the last island.

It's made up of 3 small expansions that were released in 2019.&#10;&#10;Players race to rewrite history in their favor using a deck of only 18 cards. Players use equipment, exploit paradoxes in the time-space continuum, and author their own revision of the past. Featuring a clever multi-sided card system, every card is used by both players based on what they can see. Equipping that card for yourself may just give your opponent the ability they were looking for. Every turn, players activate up to two revealed cards, which each have special effects. After the effects are resolved, the player can optionally score a card to earn up to 3 points depending on how closely they match it. The first player to 16 points wins. It takes careful planning and a bit of luck to avoid failing like you have so many times before. This time will be different.&#10;&#10;This time...&#10;&#10;&#10;This can be played on its own or combined with The Perfect Moment and expansions.&#10;&#10;Includes 3 previously released expansion sets of the series, and the solo mode rule set:&#10;&#10;     1979: A Job Interview Gone Wrong&#10;     1987: A Little Espionage Gone Wrong&#10;     2010: An Escape Plan Gone Wrong&#10;     The Perfect Moment: Echoes (2nd version)&#10;&#10;&#10;",

The emperor thus began a competition for shogun between his two greatest samurai. You and an opponent will vie for the title as you coerce one village after another, searching for the three resources vital to the creation of the fighting infantry called Ashigaru &ndash; men, food and gold. Will you be able to unite the major clans, better your opponent and become shogun? Find out by playing all three games of Ashigaru:1567 &ndash; making wise decisions, using clever card management, and playing winning 3-Card Poker hands! (Note: This is the first in a series of low-cost games using the 3CP Game Engine&trade;, which employs custom cards plus a user-supplied 52-card deck of standard playing cards.)&#10;&#10;During the game, players try to win Ashigaru cards by playing 3-card poker hands from a standard deck. However, it's not as simple as it first appears. Since you get a new card every round, will you hold onto a pair of jacks, for example, hoping for a third -- making three-of-a-kind? Or break up two Aces to use one in a straight? A simple, easily memorized chart determines what Ashigaru cards you get -- and the better your winning hand, the better the cards you win.&#10;&#10;There are three related games included, of easy to moderate complexity. All are simple to learn, fun to play and balanced, with a fairly high tension level.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Print &amp; Play cards available in Files section.&#10;     Professionally produced card deck available at thegamecrafter.com.&#10;&#10;&#10;",

      name: "Guts ‘N Glory: WWII Combat System for N scale Miniatures",
      description: "Guts &lsquo;N Glory is a World War II skirmish rules system for N-scale Miniatures.&#10;&#10;This innovative system allows for faster game resolution taking into account troop quality, leadership, and moral. &#10;The game was designed to be a pleasing combination of playability and realism.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game system is a fairly innovative concept (at least to historical gaming) that uses different dice rather than die modifiers. In most games, one type of dice is used and the &quot;success&quot; number for hitting a target, spotting a target or passing morale is determined by adding or subtracting a number from a base number. This forces the player to go through some mathematical calculations each time and the &quot;success&quot; number always changes. In Guts 'N Glory, the &quot;success&quot; number never changes. Instead, the dice you roll changes. &#10;For example, a successful morale check is made on a roll of a 4 or less. Veteran troops usually roll a 6-sided die to check morale (66% chance), but green troops roll a 10-sided die (40% chance). Of course, things happen to make troops more or less likely to pass that morale check. In Guts 'N Glory, these factors are taken into account by the use of &quot;die higher penalties&quot; or &quot;die lower bonuses.&quot; When checking morale, you put your finger on the &quot;dice hierarchy&quot; chart and move it to the right for each penalty and to the left for each bonus. No need to add/subtract modifiers&hellip;.No need to remember a different &quot;success&quot; number for every roll you make. &#10;For example, let's say a veteran fire team needs to take a morale check. There are enemy tanks visible to the fire team, they were under fire last turn and they are in cover. The enemy tanks and being under fire are both &quot;die higher penalties.&quot; The fact that the team is in cover is a &quot;die lower bonus. This yields a net result of one &quot;die higher&quot; penalty. The veteran fire team checks for morale by rolling an 8-sided die instead of the usual 6-sided die. The &quot;success&quot; number for a morale check is always a four or less. The use of this concept really speeds up play.&#10;&#10;Guts 'N Glory only considers factors that are necessary to create a realistic simulation. We didn't deal with details that added complexity/realism at the expense of playability. For example, in Guts 'N Glory tank armor is classified as light, medium, heavy or very heavy. &#10;There are bonuses/penalties on the charts for sloped armor, side armor, rear armor and top armor. Also, if a tank is hit, you then check to see whether or not it was immobilized or put &quot;out of action.&quot; This is all any platoon commander needs to know anyway. Therefore a Tiger tank is still a tougher target than a Stuart tank, but we didn't create an overly complicated system to model this. No need to find out exactly where the round hit, exactly what systems were taken out, or which crewmember was killed.&#10;&#10;Don't think that Guts 'N Glory is a beer and pretzels game though. &#10;It plays fast, but it rewards good tactics. It also punishes the player who makes tactical mistakes. &#10;The results are very realistic when compared with historical instances. &#10;Another concept that speeds play is the use of &quot;fire teams.&quot; Infantry are grouped in teams of 2-5 men. Three fire teams make up a squad. The troops are individually based on metal stands. The fire team stands are magnetic. This allows you to tailor your fire teams to the situation at hand. You can decide which weapons go with which team and your squad leader can be attached to any team you wish. The rules allow you to detach tank hunters as well. Squads generally were divided up into teams to execute real battle tactics. It speeds up the game considerably to allow you to move your men in similar teams. All members of a fire team direct their fire at the same target (with the exception of tank hunters&hellip;They need to be free to engage armored targets.) when they fire. This speeds up play and is very reasonable when compared with accounts of actual combat.&#10;&#10;Guts 'N Glory uses an initiative system and special fire modes or orders that allow both players to exercise control over their troops at the same time. &#10;It is not an &quot;I go, you go&quot; system. &#10;This adds realism to the simulation. I must admit that it is the hardest part of the system to grasp, but the most rewarding. &#10;For example, veteran troops are easier to control than green troops. They have a better chance of gaining the initiative and have more special orders to give. This makes them more flexible to the changing battlefield environment. We believe that this is how it should be!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

      description: "An Educational Criminal Law Game&#10;&#10;Jailbait is an exciting simulation of the real world of crime. It is both entertaining and designed to teach the lay person about the criminal justice system. The player will be taken through the court process, starting with bail hearings and lawyer's fees through to the trial and sentencing. Players will enjoy playing the roles of police officers, lawyers and Judges (sic). The winner of the game is the player with the most amount of money, but, he must also have the least number of criminal convictions.&#10;&#10;Jailbait equipment consists of a board with crime squares, tokens for the various players, one die, Judge's dice, Jailbait money, small chips which are the players' conviction chips and 3 sets of cards&mdash;crime cards (which correspond to the various crime squares on the board), lawyer's fee/bail cards and pre-trial cards.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the person with the most amount of money after he purchases back all his conviction chips. The game may conclude at any time, simply purchase back the conviction chips and count your money. Alternatively, the game concludes when only two players are left playing.&#10;&#10;This game was designed to follow the actual process of the Canadian Criminal Justice system as closely as possible within the framework of a game. There are many aspects and possibilities that arise within the court system which were impossible to include: however, the pertinent section of the Criminal Code of Canada has been noted in the glossary when appropriate to enable the player to obtain further information if he or she so desires by referring to that document. The United States glossary version will follow.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The game system remains basically the same, allowing players to focus on planning and strategy and not an overbearing rules system. Based on that new research and feedback, many units have been adjusted, all of the maps have minor changes, and some whole rules sections have been revamped to better represent the historical reality, while minimizing further complexity. The original expansion is included in this Deluxe Edition (while remaining optional), and there are also new scenarios.&#10;&#10;",

Some blame inaction or even conspiracy for not deflecting the asteroid. Others see the possibility of creating a new and better world. Eight mega-organizations emerge, vying for the chance to take charge of rebuilding our post-apocalyptic planet. Each has a plan that relies on emerging technology and prevailing public opinion. The plans are wildly different: from building a green utopia to merging with machines in a matrix to fleeing Earth entirely and colonizing a nearby planet. But there are only enough resources left for one of these plans to succeed. And each step of the way, other players will try to compete for the same resources or even oppose you directly.&#10;&#10;You are the chosen leader in a mega-organization. You must convince the public that not only are your ideas the best of those presented by the mega-organizations&mdash;but also that you are the one who can save the world and lead it safely into the future. Your task is to assemble teams focused on technologies to influence humanity's future. It is up to you whether to turn Earth into an authoritarian regime, liberate people from their oppressors, change what it means to be human, return to living in harmony with nature, let the free market reign, or control human behavior with a supercomputer.&#10;&#10;You begin the game by choosing a mega-organization card, two technology cards, and four agent cards. Each turn, you draw one card and get two points you can spend to draw cards, move agents, execute special abilities, or research new technologies. You can also trade cards for points to execute more complex turns. The table is split into three lanes: development, commercial, and monopoly, representing stages of bringing a technology to market. Each gives you prestige, public opinion, or effect bonuses you can use during or at the end of the game. You can move a card to the next stage when the assigned team's skills fulfill the card's requirements. When resolving conflicts with other teams working on the same technology, your agents' skills determine who strikes first and how much damage an agent can cause and withstand.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all technologies in the game are developed, or if you win the tug-of-war of public opinion and successfully initiate a revolution. In this case, tally the prestige from your developed technologies and add bonus prestige from your technologies that align with the prevailing public opinion. The player with the most prestige wins the game and the chance to make an IMPACT BEYOND.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

The battle is fought with the formation of energetic majorities; thus: a 2-FS neutralizes an enemy 1-FS, two 2-FS neutralize an enemy 3, etc. Neutralized FS remain as (impassable) space trash, but can be reactivated. Another scenario is collecting ore.&#10;&#10;Flying Saucers has an expansion. This contains more scenarios such as the production of panels and the expansion of base stations, the abduction of the robot pilots and some exciting new spaceships.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;",

You must choose a dice from the middle of the table, but if you pick the same as someone else, then battle it out to see who gets that dice and who loses their card!&#10;&#10;&#10;How to play: Place all the giant squishy dice in the center of the table and take your deck of cards. Secretly choose which dice card you want to play, and on the count of 3 reveal it to the other players. Grab the dice you chose and prepare to roll them! If anyone matches their cards, you brawl with the chosen dice.The last player hit will gain their opponent&rsquo;s cards and the losers have to choose from the leftover dice. Now everyone rolls their dice in turn - starting with the D20 and down to the D6 with the highest number winning. But watch out for the special cards! Losteroid cards are blackholes that will suck all the cards away in the round and reduce your score if you end up with one in your score pile.

Each team has a deck of fighters, bonus and robot equipment cards.  The speed of your fighters will determine the turn order of each day where players will battle each other's fighters and try to break or fix the shield generators.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

Players can choose; Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Crusade, or Survival Mode.&#10;&#10;In &quot;Crusade&quot; mode players occupy bases around a map over the course of several rounds. In Survival Mode players cooperatively fight against waves of AI generated and operated themed opponents such as zombies, or aliens, or the dreaded escaped zoo animals.&#10;&#10;Bottom Line is this is a fun board game with endless replicability and options.&#10;&#10;",

Each board has spaces for 4 servings each of Fruit &amp; Vegetables, Bread &amp; Cereal, and Dairy, and 2 spaces each for Meat and Bonus items. On turn, spin the spinner then draw a card from the food group matching the color spun and decide if you want to buy it. If you don&rsquo;t buy it, return it to the bottom of the deck. If you buy it, draw a Pot Luck card and pay the price for the item as det by the item card and Pot Luck card then discard the Pot Luck card and place the item on its matching space on your checkout counter. If all such spaces are filled, you may place the card on a Bonus Item space or hold it to trade or sell. In lieu of drawing a card, you may use your turn to sell or trade a food card to another player for food or money. If a player makes an incorrect challenge, any other player may challenge them. The person who was wrong (the player or the challenger) must pay the bank the correct amount without receiving a card. Game ends when a player fills their checkout counter entirely. That player gets a 100-point bonus. Players then score 25 points for each item on their counter and 1 point for each penny not spent. High score wins. As a variant, deal each P a People card at the start of the game. Each card shows a calorie target. During scoring, subtract one point for each calorie above or below the target.&#10;&#10;",

The first edition is a map of the United States.&#10;&#10;We welcome fellow explorers, dreamers, trailblazers, curiosity-seekers and casual bucket-listers of every kind to the Bucket Race!&#10;&#10;The game consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;1. Setting up the game:&#10; - Game setup&#10; - Player setup&#10; - Choose a Home Destination&#10;&#10;2. Game flow:&#10; - First Turn, Every Turn&#10; - Additional Actions&#10; - Ending the Game&#10;&#10;The board has the following components:  &#10; - Game board (map of US with 5 distinct region with 1 reward lounge each, 45 destinations with a # between 2-12, spaces for 2 supplies that are randomized at the game's onset)&#10; - Game pieces: 2 dice, 5 player pieces, 52 deck of Surprise! Cards, 52 deck of Upgrade Cards, 5 wet erase markers, 90 supplies, 5 reward lounge tokens, Money&#10; - Rules booklet&#10; - 18 Persona Cards/Bucket Lists - the heart of the game is selecting a Persona Card/Bucket List which is the character you will take on and have to complete their bucket list the fastest in order to win.&#10;&#10;Game flow: &#10;Each turn players first collect $100, then roll the dice to see if they can collect additional money (many ways through dice rolls, Surprise! Cards, also if roll doubles get an additional $100!).  Then they use money to pay to move their game piece, collect and manage supplies, check-off bucket list items, visit rewards lounges for additional upgrade cards, redeem upgrade cards if in possession, or trade and sell supplies to other players.&#10;&#10;The first player to check-off all Bucket List items on their Persona Card and travel back to their &ldquo;Home&rdquo; destination, wins the Bucket Race!&#10;&#10;This is a game where it is best to collaborate early on (trade supplies, help each other out), but then the last stretch it is truly a race to see who can win first!&#10;&#10;Additionally, the bucket list items are based on real-life bucket lists, so we like to think this is a learning and travel game as well!  It is perfect for those that love competitive, strategy board games with travel and culture.&#10;&#10;3-5 players or can play in teams.  There are 3 versions (Easy Tenderfoot, Medium Trailblazer, Advanced Globetrotter).  We recommend starting with Easy first to get the hang of the game.  Usually takes between 50-75 minutes to play, although for experienced gamers you could complete in 30-45 minutes if do a speed round.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;",

The next player then starts their day phase, until everyone has completed their day and night falls.

While the goal of the travelers is to go home, Maligno aims to consume all the gas in order to kill them before they go home.&#10;&#10;The trip will involve hidden information. As the maligno may curse and kill during the night, humans must find out who are their ally and their enemies. They must use their social skills to convince other players that they are on the good team, even if they are actually on the bad team. Actions, body language, and behavior of every player must be considered.&#10;&#10;Each day, a designated driver is elected by the group. During each turn, the driver and navigator will work together to decide which route to take. Every action is dictated by a random deck. Players must figure out if the actions of the driver are based on luck or based on deception.&#10;&#10;The objective of the Human team is to make sure the car token reach Manila. The objective of the Maligno team is to consume all gas so that the car token will not reach Manila. The board map is divided into 4 blocks or days. Each day, a designated driver is elected by the group who will decide the final action of the car token. When the car token landed on a location that is found beyond or on the boundary of blocks/days, then the night phase is initiated. Players will sleep during the night phase.&#10;&#10;The movement of the car token is dependent on turns. A navigator is assigned each turn to work with the driver. Navigators are automatically assigned counter-clockwise of the driver, starting on the right of the driver. Each turn, the navigator draws 3 action card from the deck and discards 1 action card. The navigator will pass the remaining 2 action card to the driver. The driver selects 1 action card and discards the other. A new turn will occur after the driver selects the final action card.&#10;&#10;The driver has the choice to reject any card that is handed by the navigator. Navigation rejection may only be done if the driver has not yet seen the action cards. The navigation bar on the board describes how many rejection has been made. Each day, three rejections may be done by the driver. The navigation bar resets each day. Depending on the action card, the car token may move from one location to another. Only the driver may place the car token to its proper place.&#10;&#10;Maligno, from the Filipino folklore, is a concept encompassing numerous malevolent creatures that embody misfortune, illness, and all things evil. The nature of these beings, who are often depicted as agents of chaos and suffering, are shapeshifters that are believed to inflict illness, possess individuals, manipulate dreams, and even cause death. Their presence is often associated with unusual occurrences, like inexplicable sounds, sudden illnesses, and unexplained misfortunes.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

It was part of the northern pincer of the Rzhev-Sychevka Strategic Offensive (Operation Mars). The Soviet objective was to liberate the Russian city of Velikiye Luki and to cut the north-south rail line to the west of the city.&#10;&#10;Rather than attacking the town directly, the Soviet forces advanced into the difficult terrain to the north and south of the town. Despite heavy losses, they successfully cut the land links to the city, trapping the garrison. Hitler demanded that all the surrounded formations hold out while relief forces counterattacked to open a route to the encircled units. The garrison held out against repeated and determined Russian assaults. In the meantime, Soviet attempts to take their main objective, the rail lines at Novosokolniki, had been frustrated by the counter-attacks of the relief force. An attempt by the Germans to reach Velikiye Luki in late December ran into stubborn Soviet defense and was halted. The German garrison finally surrendered on January 16th.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

The mix of rotting fish and peculiar additives made her hallucinate. In a very extraordinary feverish trip, seven personalities diverged to manifest the seven houses of Muffins Magical Kingdom. Through acts of political discourse, and the clever use of magical tails, the Houses began to vie for control as they sway the tides of the Muffins Mind.&#10;&#10;Muffin's Magical Kingdom is a semi-cooperative trick-taking game for 3 or more players, that plays in 20-45 minutes depending on the number of players. It plays in exactly 21 tricks.&#10;&#10;We start with the dealer, who comes in the form of a Rat trying to put the pieces of Muffin back together again. They randomly deal a House and 10 cards to each player. The Rat then chooses the Trump House which serves a dual purpose for scoring. Each trick won, the player collects not only the cards from the trick but also the Trump house card.&#10;&#10;Each House has a special ability that is a reflection of their personality trait that is triggered whenever the card is played. These abilities can manipulate players hands, communication, and their future. Players may communicate by passing messages through courier Rats, but each message sent can be read by the Rat player so all houses should handle with care.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all 21 tricks are won, or any player wins a Trick from all 7 Houses. If the Rat player wins all 7 Houses, they immediately win the game. If a House player wins all 7 Houses, they immediately lose the game and the Rat wins.&#10;&#10;Scoring is based on the house and playing cards won during each each. 1 point for each card, 5 points for each card with a matching house, and 10 points for each card where all house cards are collected for that house. There are 4 cards for each house inclusive of the one randomly dealt at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

Each round, you place survivors on building tiles to produce benefits to your compound (food, barricades, weapons, meds, and repairs ). At the end of each round, a vicious mob of marauders will attack the compound. You must strategically place your barricades, assign your survivors, and distribute your weapons to protect and defend against the ravenous marauders.

Collect the most value in coins by forming simple mathematical equations that yield a street delivery address for a target house.&#10;&#10;MODES: &#10;Younger Child Play: Only the addition operators will be used and house numbers will range from 11 to 20.&#10;Full Play: All mathematical operators are used with house numbers 11-99.&#10;&emsp;&#10;SETUP:  &#10;&bull; Arrange the houses into your choice of neighbourhoods with one mailbox per group (see Neighbourhoods below)&#10;&bull; Shuffle the number tiles and operators upside down in two separate draw piles&#10;&bull; Assign each house an address using random number tiles (1-9 only) face up.&#10;&bull; Place a coin on each house base as follows: one ($) for addresses 11-50, ($$) for addresses 51+.&#10;&bull; Place three number tiles and one operator tile face up on each mailbox base.&#10;&bull; Each player grabs a mail truck.&#10;&bull; Each player grabs one number tile to keep in secret.&#10;&#10;END OF GAME CONDITIONS:&#10;Agree upon what constitutes the end of the game:&#10;&bull; Abandoned Homes: upon picking up money, the house is abandoned and will no longer have an address.&#10;&bull; Target Score: play until a player has collected coins that total a minimum value like 5 points.&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY:  &#10;On each turn, a player has 30 seconds to do the following: &#10;&bull; Move their truck to either a mailbox or house.&#10;&bull; When at a mailbox, pick up one or more required tiles into their truck slots, replacing empty mailbox slots with fresh tile(s) from the draw pile(s).&#10;&bull; When at a house, call out their equation and destination address, allowing opponent(s) to verify the math is correct; collect the coin; replace the house with two fresh tiles (unless abandoned); discard all the tiles from the truck.&#10;&#10;Secret Number Tile:&#10;Place your secret number tile into your truck at any time. Once used, grab another number tile to keep secret.&#10;&#10;Mailbox Operations:&#10;A truck at a mailbox may either:&#10;&bull; Take one or more tiles from the mailbox and place in the truck; replace all empty mailbox slots with new tile(s) from the appropriate draw pile(s)&#10;&#10;House Operations:&#10;If the truck is in the same neighbourhood as their destination address, the player calls out their equation and collects the coins.&#10;&#10;If the truck fulfills their equation and is not at the neighbourhood with the destination address, the player must wait until their next turn to move their truck to the correct neighbourhood.&#10;&#10;TIP: Before selecting tiles at a mailbox, choose wisely based on the addresses you see.&#10;&#10;FORMING EQUATIONS:&#10;Form math equations by using at least two numbers and one operator. The equation is formed within the base of your truck. The solution to the equation will be the address of a house (destination). To form the equation, collect the correct numbers and operator(s). Examples:&#10;&#10;Valid Matching Equations&#10;7+7    2x5+4   20-6   all match house number 14.&#10;&#10;ENDING THE GAME:&#10;Keep playing until no one can collect any more tiles.&#10;&#10;WINNING THE GAME:&#10;The winner will have the most value in coins. If there is a tie, play another round.&#10;&#10;EXCEPTIONS:&#10;You cannot stop in a neighbourhood where there is another truck.

Your tools are wands, pentacles, swords, and cups: the cards of the Minor Arcana, which allow you to control the four elements of nature. Four Major Arcana cards are dealt in a diamond pattern so that the Minor Arcana cards can be placed adjacent to them on each side. The player tries to subjugate one or more of these cards by surrounding them with a Minor Arcana card of each suit, the sum of which also exceeds the value of the Major Arcana card. The player can use the Magician card to activate special powers, including the power to change the suit of a card to a wild suit. When cards are subjugated, both the Major Arcana and the surrounding Minor Arcana cards are discarded. Some Major Arcana cards have addition requirements for subjugating them, and others offer rewards after being subjugated. There are also expansion cards which include even more requirements and rewards for greater variability. If the player can subjugate all 21 Major Arcana before the Minor Arcana deck runs out, they win.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

      description: "Geisha-themed game for 2-4 players, where you compete to gain the favor of the emperor getting your character more elegant than the others.&#10;&#10;It's a set collection game focused on getting more points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;At the start of Kimono you have to choose a maiko to support. You display the Kakemono board and take the six buttons for you chosen character. Depending on the number of players, you use more or less  fabric cards and accessories.&#10;&#10;Each card has a number and a pair of signs (Animal, vegetal, or three marks of the draper) which will be used to make combinations and scoring points. Cards are displayed at the center of the table, alongside the Kakemono board, in a 4 lines x 4 cards or 5x3 disposition for 2/4 players and 3 players respectively.&#10;&#10;The main phase of the game is called the Market phase. All the fabric cards and accessories will be displayed at the centre of the table, but only those matching the selected colours.&#10;In the draw phase, a player must draw one card that is on the extreme right of any line of their choice.  Players must draw them in their turns in order to make combinations, which appear on the Kakemono board a the center of the table. That's is the way a player can score points on this game.&#10;&#10;For example, in an attempt to make a Katyou Fugetsu kakemono player 1 will need 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 cards with the Animal mark on them. Player 1 can use 2 cards with the same number (for example 2) with the animal mark on it, and, as marked on the Kakemono board, he will score two points. Player 1 must put the button on the Kakemono board in the matching combination and no other player can make that combination again.&#10;&#10;The end of the game arrives when each player has drawn 12 cards. In this phase, players gain points for each combination made, also if they used the 12 cards they drawn there is 2 extra points for those players. Each accessory card is equal to 1 extra point. Finally, players score how many kinds of fabric they used as listed on the kakemono board. The player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

You must navigate a dangerous world, evading the police while trying to win Bonnie Parker's heart. Every decision matters, from resource management to avoiding law confrontations, as you carve your path to destiny.&#10;&#10;In this game, Bonnie&rsquo;s presence through her poetry is a constant influence on your choices. Her spirit and writings add a romantic and narrative dimension, as you, playing as Clyde, seek to earn her affection and forge the bond that will unite them in history.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Each turn, you have (at best) 4 actions to distribute in order to optimally manage your resources while paying the cost of living and avoiding being imprisoned too often or too quickly. You need to accumulate poems, love, and boredom, as well as ammunition, before stealing a 1927 Ford A and embarking on the roads of &quot;Bonnie and Clyde, Love and Death&quot; before being killed by the police.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;",

The player takes on the role of the the archangel Raphael and must find 22 pairs of lovers from the Minor Arcana to connect their fates each to a different Major Arcana before the deck runs out. Lovers must share the same rank or the same suit, and their values can be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided to match the value of a Major Arcana card. Nobles (represented by the court cards) can be used to bless certain unions, altering the individual or total value of the lovers. But they must be used sparingly, since the end of the deck means the end of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

      description: "An eternal conflict for the land of Ironwood is raging between two factions: the stalwart and hard-working Ironclad, settlers of the iron mountains; and the ferocious Woodwalkers, swift and deadly shadows of the forests. Both factions struggle for the ultimate control over the land for its greatest treasure: the Larimor Crystals, a mysterious substance holding immense energy within. It can be found both inside the colossal mountains and scattered across the dense forests.&#10;&#10;The Ironclad extract the essence of the crystals and process their energy to fuel their machines and mechanical inventions. If they succeed, their giant forges will swarm the land with endless armies, and establish ultimate dominance over Ironwood.&#10;&#10;The Woodwalkers use the crystals&rsquo; raw magical power to discover and retrieve three ancient totems from secret ritual sites, hidden in the mountains. Once retrieved, the combined power of these totems will summon the Guardian, the ancient protector of the woods, to wipe out the Ironclad once and for all.&#10;&#10;One way or another, the eternal conflict is finally coming to an end.&#10;&#10;Ironwood is a rules-light, highly asymmetric, card-driven tactical game for 1-2 players. Each round, you and your opponent alternate playing a total of 3 of your faction-specific cards for their action effects. These effects include positioning your warbands, initiating combat, extracting crystals, bestowing temporary passive effects, and many more. When combat occurs, you will use the same cards for their combat values instead, in a simultaneous bid to gain combat bonuses, inflict and fend off casualties, and augment the Dominance value of your warbands to win the combat.&#10;&#10;The two factions are completely asymmetric in their play styles, decks, victory conditions - even in which parts of the map they can access.&#10;&#10;As the Commander of the Ironclad, your primary goal is to lay down the foundations of your forges in the outer mountains, and once you have collected enough crystals, build forges on the foundations. As the Chieftain of the Woodwalkers, your mission is to locate your people&rsquo;s ancient totems through Vision cards, clear the path to them by defeating Ironclad warbands, and finally securing them in the outer forests, beyond the Ironclads&rsquo; reach. Once you have retrieved the third totem as the Chieftain, or built the third Forge as the Commander, you immediately win the game.&#10;&#10;Ironwood also features a low-upkeep solo mode against the Ironclad or the Woodwalkers. Although both solo opponents work on the same main principles, each of them bears its faction&rsquo;s unique aspects and features.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

It is not so much the game, but the art of Ritta Nakanishi that makes this game so popular.  Ritta is noted for his military illustrations and military model art.  This game is fully illustrated from top to bottom (well, not the bottom of the box) with his wonderful art featuring all sorts of horror.&#10;&#10;In addition, the entirety of the box is used.  In fact, there are four tops/lids that are illustrated and used in the game.  The result is a three-dimension board where the players move through different levels.  There are even pitfalls at the highest level, as well as caves, in addition to foldable terrain pieces.  To top this off, there is a facade that fits to the back of the board featuring the game's objective. All this creates a highly immersed game experience.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;",
